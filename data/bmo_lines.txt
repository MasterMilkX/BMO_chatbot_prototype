X: Safety! Patrol!
X: Safety! Patrol! Safety patrol! Safety— Oh... Were we not wearing the uniforms?
X: C'mon. Let's keep lookin' for hazards. Look out!
X: What is it, dude?
X: Shushers, man! Look there!
X: Just looks like an ordinary little town, man.
X: Yeah... Suspiciously ordinary. Oh! Little house people! Maybe it is just regular ordinary, not sinister ordinary—oh, no, wait... Grass ogre.
X: Haha!
X: It's an obnoxious grass ogre.
X: You get my joke, right?! Hahaha!
X: Careful, you oaf! Those chickens are rentals! Agh!
X: We're havin' so much fun, huh?!
X: Drop that chicken!
X: Huh?
X: You're under arrest! Good... Now get in your tiny cell... Oh, uh, oh!
X: Hey, ogre! Stop hazing these cute little houses!
X: Ya jerkball!
X: My name is Donny, idiot!
X: Sorry. I was just tryina' get your attention.
X: What kinda houses are you supposed to be? A... stupid... uh... a dumb house?! Haha! Hey, what's with your jowl?!
X: Ow!
X: Hahaha! I'm gonna mess with these housies some more.
X: NEVER!!
X: So you wanna wrestle, huh? 'Cause I know, like, this ninja move to get out of this lock instantly! Okay... Now, first I... Hey! You're doin' it wrong!!
X: Whoa.
X: You're doin' it wrong!
X: Whaddaya mean?
X: First, you roll your right shoulder forward...
X: Like this?
X: Yeah, but then I counter it by doin' this!
X: Hey!
X: Um... You need to take a break?
X: No... but if you need to, we can stop... Ya baby.
X: Whoa, I zoned out there for a bit. Did you win?
X: Nah. Just takin' five. Donny's pretty good.
X: Yeah, well, you're okay, too.
X: Thanks, man.
X: ...For a complete idiot!
X: Aww...
X: Donald, quit all this jerky nonsense! Unless you wanna get gored by a forest prince!
X: I was just kiddin' around, but then you took it too far! You guys are the real jerks!
X: Donny is one mixed-up dude.
X: Nah. He's just rough-and-tumble, like me, but deep down, he's probably really sensitive, like me.
X: You're a mixed-up dude, too!
X: Hey, Donny!
X: What?
X: I was thinkin' that since you're a pretty good wrestler, maybe you'd wanna hang out with a couple a' rascals like me and Jake!
X: What?
X: Muuuh... I don't know. Messin' with these housies is pretty fun. You got somethin' better?
X: You sure this is a good idea?
X: If you come to the Tree Fort, we got video games and apple juice!
X: I mean... if it keeps you from cryin'...
X: Donny's problem is that he's treated like an outsider, like me.
X: You are not an outsider. You wear cute little blue shorts!
X: I... am complicated.
X: Uh... This fort isn't so great. Not as cool as the fort I'm gonna build. I call this chair!
X: Hey, Donny, you should play Bug Battle.
X: And hey, can you put on some pants?!
X: You put on some pants!
X: I have pants... spun from spiderwebs... by pixies.
X: Okay. There's you, and here come the bugs.
X: Huh?!
X: Oh, yeah. Those guys'll get ya.
X: Not cool, dude.
X: Have more apple juice. It always makes me feel better when I— Aaah! Donny! Quit being a jerk!
X: What? What'd I do?
X: Finn, I don't think this is gonna work.
BMO: I am incapable of all emotion.... but you are making me chafed!!
X: Everybody's gettin' mad at me for nothin'!
X: You have to think about how your actions make other people feel.
X: Ohh. Hmm. I don't understand at all.
X: Ooh! Teach him that little empathy song I taught you!
X: Okay, yeah! Your turn!
X: Uh... Empathy, empathy, put yourself... Ohh! So it's like, when I squeeze eggs outta chickens, I should let them squeeze eggs outta me, too!
X: ...Um... kinda right.
X: Dude, trade me jobs.
X: Jake! Someone broke your... um... entire living room!
X: Quick! Act abandoned!
X: Hands off the housing market!
X: Stop in the name of the law!
X: Is there somewhere I can trap that thing?
X: Well, there was a zoo, but he moved back east. Course, there's always the old well.
X: I'm not old!
X: Perfect! Slam-bam-in-a-can! Huh? Another werewolf?!? What's up with this town?!
[A Siamese twin wolf bites attacks the bank house. Finn forces the wolf into the well with another House Person.
X: Mr. Bank! Are you alright?!
X: Oh, it's fine, it's fine. All my assets are insured. Pardon. I have to go spackle my cracks.
X: Why is this town just getting worse and worse?
X: Yes! Why indeed!!
X: Hey! What are you werewolves up to?!
X: We're not werewolves... We're Why-wolves.
X: Uh... Why-wolves?
X: Creatures possessed by the spirit of inquiry..... AND... BLOODLUST!!
X: What?!
X: Oh, no! I have to get Donny back!
X: Donny, you have to go right now, and stop the Why-wolves from—
X: Ah! Master Finn has returned!
X: What's it goin'?!
X: Thanks to you, I shall never be jerky again!
X: Oh, no... Oh, no. Oh, no, nonononononono! No! This is all wrong! We need jerk Donny to make the obnoxygen, and, and—
X: I'll fetch you some tap water.
X: Are you wearing jeans now?!
X: Surely!
X: But, but, but—
X: Butt, butt, butt! Yeah, Donny! You're lookin' good in those jeans!
X: What did you do?!
X: Miraculous, isn't it? I just kept teachin' him my musical rules, and now, he's perfect.
X: No! We messed up, Jake! The House People are doomed if Donny doesn't go back to being town jerk!
X: I have no intention of being a jerk again. Hmph.
X: But the housies will be wiped out if you don't!
X: It sounds tragic, but I'm turning over a new leaf!
X: Donny, you gotta go!
X: Finn, "no" means, "no." I'm sure you'll respect my wishes. No! Stop! No!
X: Now, go be a jerk to those Why-wolves!
X: No! I'll use my musical messages to stop them! Let's see... I've got one on the ethics of laundry... Crosswalk-ery... Ooh! Here's a good one!
X: Man! The town is getting creamed! By not being a jerk, you're being a real jerk, Donny!!
X: Why isn't anybody paying attention to my words?
X: It's cuz they think your songs are dumb!
X: Wha?!
X: HEY, DONNY! EVERYONE SAYS YOUR SONGS ARE SUPER BALLS!!
X: They all think you're a real jerk!
X: But... but I've changed! Why would they say that?! Empathy, empathy, put your mind insi...
X: You're so pathetic! So comical!
X: HAHAHAHA!!
X: Obnoxygen cloud!! EGRESS!!
X: The town is saved!!
X: Get offa' me, nerds!!
X: You did it, Donny! You're a full-blown jerk again!
X: What?! You're the jerk!! Housies! Ready to hear my new song?! It's about how Finn will betray you, just to save lives!
X: I'm sorry, Donny.
X: I'll never forgive you, Finn!! WAAAAAAH!!!
X: C'mon. We can go stare wistfully at the lake.
X: I'd... I'd like that. Very much.
X: Hey! I love bein' a jerk! Thanks, Finn! Finn? I'll never... forget you!


=== S1E23 ===
X: Jake, get ready for a slap in the jowls. Seriously, though... get ready... for a day filled with adventure!
X: Whoa, really?!
X: Yeah, man!! storm clouds?
X: I've never seen a knife storm before... It's beautiful.
X: Looks like we're stayin' in today, kid.
X: Well, what're we gonna do?
BMO: Who wants to play video games??
X: BMO!!
X: What's on the menu, BMO?
BMO: I've created a new game called Conversation Parade.
X: Hah! Alright!
X: Start it up, BMO!
BMO: What do you think about the stars in the sky?
X: 'S okay, I guess.
X: Yeah, they're cool.
BMO: That is an interesting response! Battery low... Shut doooowwwwn...
X: Booooo.
X: BMO, that was weak.
X: What now?
X: Ooh, ooh! Dude, I know somethin' totally rockin' we can do!
X: Whoa! What?!
X: Let's use our imaginations, man!
X: Barf that! Imagination is for turbo nerds who can't handle how kick-butt reality is! I'm a kick-butt reality master!! I would rather die than be imaginative. I mean that.
X: Eh. Your loss. Lava on the floor!
X: Shut up, man...
X: Seriously, man! There must be an enchantment on the house or somethin'!
X: I'm not playing you child-style games, guy. Watch and learn as I master... reality.
X: NOOOOO!!
X: Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jake! What the hey-hey?!
X: I was just playin' around with my imagination... ...and then everything got intense.
X: It's like... whatever you imagine becomes real... That's bananas!
X: Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain... Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs...
X: Dude! Imagine that BMO invented a better video game, and that he has new batteries.
X: WHOA!
X: But first stop imagining lava!
X: I can't! My imagination's too amazing!
X: Imagine turning your imagination off!
X: I can't, dude... but I think I can imagine an imagination turning-off machine... that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and... and... girls. Cute girls, and hamsters.
X: Can't you make it easier to get to that machine?
X: You can't hold this baby back! That's bad parenting, mamma!
X: Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown! Let's go to the den and suit up!
X: Neat! Grab that missile.
X: Okay.
X: And... get that cosmic gauntlet.
X: Nah. There's a better one over by the desk. Ah! UNH! What did I just hit?!
X: I'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it.
X: Really? That's it? There isn't any invisible, angry troll or anything?
X: Oh, there's one now. Look out!
X: Aah! I can feel it on my foot! I'll kill you, troll! Yah! Yah! Yah, yah, yah, yah!
X: You're kickin' too high! He's shorter than you!
X: Yah, yah!
X: Alright! You're gettin' him, man! She's comin' back for revenge.
X: Cram this! We gotta book it to your imagination machine! Yah!
X: The knife storm, remember?!?! Here, man. Try some.
X: Okay. Try to imagine some kind of steel umbrella over the bridge so... we don't get knifed.
X: Okay! It is done.
X: Haha! Ha! Hey, you did it, man!
X: No, voyagers. To pass this bridge, you must first pass the test of the riddle.
X: An imaginary riddle master?
X: Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master. I accept your test.
X: Then brace yourself, fool, for this riddle comes from a mysterious, far-away land.
X: LAY IT ON ME!!
X: Yes, um... The riddle, uh... It... cometh... uh...
X: I can't imagine a riddle.
X: Dude, just make it super easy.
X: THE RIDDLE COMETH! Tell me, voyager. What is simple, and yet also... a riddle?
X: Man, that riddle sucks.
X: THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER!! The penalty is... DEATH BY SNAKES!!
X: YEAH, RIGHT! I'VE GOT A MISSILE!!
X: You exploded the snakes right at us!!
X: I can feel them all over my face! Imaginary poison coursing through my veins!!
X: I'm sorry, brother! I'm so sorry!
X: Let's just get to your imagination machine and we'll be okay!!
X: AAH! A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!! JUMP, DUDE!! The Bazooka Goblin has you in its sights!
X: Hey! Don't shoot us with that bazooka!
X: Don't you do it...
X: DON'T DO IT, MAN!!!
X: Hee... heehee... hee... Okay.
X: YEAH!
X: AW, YEAH!
X: Alright, use your powers or something. This poison is about to kill me.
X: Alright. Goin' up. Check it. My imagination-off machine is left of the bed.
X: Is it clear?
X: Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls... but they shouldn't bother you.
X: Oh! I found the shut-off lever!
X: Cool, man! What're you laughin' at?
X: Alright. I'm gonna turn it off. UNH!! You said it was clear of danger!!
X: Dude... I can't see anything... I must've imagined... an invisible monster!!
X: What?! Well, how do I kill it?!
X: I'm comin', buddy! Alright, Invisibo. Eat a piece of this! Hurry, Finn! Get to the lever!
X: Okay! I'm doin' iiiit!! Hey, come on. Wake up, man.
X: Hello, Finn. I am awake and healthy.
X: Jake... what happened to your bombastic personality?
X: I do not know what you mean. I am perfectly bombastic.
X: Nah, man, nah. Somethin's wrong. Tell me something amazing!
X: But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you.
X: Ah, see, man, you suck now! Crap, it's your imagination. You need that thing.
X: Jake... Stop it, man. You're just playing one continuous note.
X: One note is all that is needed.
X: Jake! Your imagination on-off switch has vanished!
X: True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination?
X: I remembereth.
X: I am happy that my imagination is gone. It was purposeless.
X: No! It was the opposite of that stuff. I know this now... Nothing lame, at least. Hey! And there's Jake's imagination switch!
X: Now for that switch.
X: Good morrow, sir! My name is Bellamy Bug! Would you care for a crotchet doily my daughter made? She imbued it with her tears. You see, she recently broke up with a gentle dandy.
X: No! How'd you get in my Imagination Land?!
X: I don't know, my young fellow! You tell me. Perhaps I represent your secret desire to be civilized!
X: REPRESENT THIS!
X: Oh! I say! Oh! Ah! Ouch! Ah!
X: Haha... Penguins... Hahahaha! Heh, alright.
X: Aaaah!! I can imagine EVERYTHING!!!
X: Yugh!
X: You okay?
X: I think so. Lemme check. Mmmm... Yup. She's clothed now. And hey, man! It's clear out now! We can go on an adventure!
X: I don't know, dude. I think we got all the adventure we need right here... with... lava on the floor!
X: Huh?!
X: Hahahaha! Good dog.

X: Hold on! Don't make me use this, man!
X: Salt?! But I heard you guys were heroes.
X: We are heroes. We thought you were trying to attack us. Why'd you break in here all mad, squirting that juice all over us?
X: It's not mad juice. It's sad juice. My name's Snorlock, and I'm sa-a-a-a-d!
X: Stop squirting slime! Just tell us what's wrong!
X: I need a girlfriend. I have no one to love.
X: Jake, hero huddle. What do you think?
X: I think our house is all jacked up.
X: Yeah, but he's just an innocent goober looking for love.
X: Yeah. Okay, let's help him. But he's got to lay off the house.

X: Yay!
X: Whoa! Aaah!
X: Lay off the house, man!
X: All right! all right! We'll help you, dude! Just put our house back!

X: Jake, what time is it?!
X: I don't know, but you're probably going to say...
X: Lady time!
X: Okay, Snorlock, if you want a lady, you have to be yourself.
X: How do I be myself?
X: Uh, how does he be himself, Jake?
X: Just do whatever you want, man, as long as it comes from the inside.
X: Like sad juice?
X: No!
X: You keep that stuff inside you, brother. You just got to talk to 'em.
X: Oh. I never done that.
X: Finn, you see any hot mamas?
X: Ummm... Baaaaaam!
X: Go talk to her!
X: Uhmm...
X: Go talk to her!
X: Okay.
X: Oh! Hello.
X: Hi.

X: Um, are you okay?
X: Aaaaaaaaah! Girlfriend! Girlfriend!
X: Aaah!
X: Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend!
X: Dude! our house! We got to do something!
X: Relax. I got it. Snorlock! Hey, Snorlock. You okay, buddy? Went a little nuts there, guy. You got to get that under control, 'cause you're scaring ladies and jacking up our house.
X: I'm sorry. Are you gonna leave me?
X: Aw, who could leave you? Come here, you big hot mess.
X: Break it up, you two! We have ladies to attend to!
X: Yeah, the ladies.
X: Talking to ladies is hard.
X: No, it's not. Check it out, Snorlock. Finn, you be the guy snail, and I'll be... the chick snail.
X: Ugh! gross, Jake!
X: Come on, man. We're just pretending. Do it for love.
X: Okay. I'll do it for this guy.
X: What's up, lady snail?
X: Well, I'm just sitting here thinking about mating with snails.
X: No! I can't do this, man! I-am-out!
X: I'll mate with you.
X: We're just role-playing, buddy.
X: Aww.
X: Here, Finn. This time you be the chick and I'll be the snail dude.
X: Hey, baby. What's up?
X: Uh... WHA!
X: Mm-mmm! Girl, you smell good. Did you take a bath in rainbows and cupcakes?
X: Say "yes"! Say "Yes"!
X: Okay! Yes!
X: See, Snorlock? Talking to ladies is easy. Just act like me.
X: Uh... girl, you smell good.
X: You can smell me?
X: May I smell you more?
X: Uh, okay.
X: Cupcakes...
X: Uh, I have to go.
X: Did you take a bath?
X: Don't ever talk to me again.
X: Please don't go! Don't go! Aww.
X: Aw, it's okay, buddy. Come here and give us a hug.
X: Man, I wish you guys were ladies.
X: Uhh.
X: Stay focused, Snorlock. You have any cool talents that ladies might like?
X: No.
X: Umm, hey, Finn, teach him how to use swords. The princesses always love this one.
X: Yah! yah! yah! yah! Yaaaah! hyah!
X: Do you think you can do that, Snorlock?
X: I don't know.
X: Hmm. Maybe you're musical. Can you do this? Try doin' all that.
X: Hmm.
X: Whoo-hoo! yeah!
X: My word, Eleanor! What is that alluring sound?
X: I have no idea.
X: Yeah, Snorlock! Show us that talent!
X: Whoo-hoo!
X: Oh, my! What is that? What is that wonderful sound? Do I see swords?
X: Jake, these chicks look pretty serious.
X: Let's just let Snorlock do his thing. Go to it, buddy!
X: Ahh! Ooh! Ahh.

X: Hmph!
X: Snorlock, I'm gonna give you till the count of three, mister!
X: One, two, three!
X: Fine. I didn't want to have to do this.
X: Aaaaaah! Ow! ow! Owwwwwww!
X: Oh, my gosh! He's naked!
X: What? I'm naked? But I've never had a shell.
X: Snorlock, you never had a shell? That means you're not naked. You're a slug!
X: Me, a slug?
X: Yeah, man. That's why you have trouble with snail chicks. You need slug chicks.
X: I don't known any slug chicks.
X: Actually, I-I'm not really a snail. I'm a slug. My shell's made of peppermint.
X: That's gross!

X: Um... maybe give her parents some treasure?
X: No way! That's our treasure! Wait. I've got it, dude! I'll invite them over early, smooth them over using my personality, and we'll all be best friends before Lady gets here so she doesn't have to feel nervous! It's perfect! I'll just send them a quick Prism-gram.
X: What's it say?
X: Hold on. It's still converting the light waves into brain waves. Ahh... They're into it, dude!
X: Sweet! Let's go powder our noses!
X: Why's Lady so nervous, anyway?
X: Well... she didn't really say, but it might have somethin' to do with the Rainicorn-Dog Wars.
X: There were wars between rainicorns and dogs?
X: Horrifying wars. For thousands of years, rainicorns battled dogs over territory in the Crystal Dimension... but Lady and I are cool.
X: Dude! Her parents are probably all full of dog-hatred from the war-times! They're gonna see you're a dog and forbid Lady from ever hanging out with you again!
X: ...Nah. That could never happen.
X: You didn't think this through enough... IT COULD HAPPEN!!
X: AAAH! I'M A MORON!
X: Don't worry. I've got a plan that's gonna solve this biz. Homies help homies. Always.
X: I'm ready to hear your plan, homie.
X: Haha, yeah! This plan is perfect!
X: You know, I thought painting ourselves rainbow-color using condiments and stuff from the fridge so we could pretend to be rainicorns was a good idea when you pitched it to me five minutes ago, but now I'm not so sure, man.
X: Come ooonnn. Trust me, homie.
X: Huh?!
X: Jake?
X: AAAAH... LET'S HIDE AND BURN THE HOUSE DOWN!
X: 안녕하세요. ("Hello.")
X: Jake, is that you?
X: Uh-huh.
X: Are you going to let us in?
X: Y-yeeeaaah...
X: AAAAAAHHHH!!!
X: I can explain!! I can explain!!
X: OOOHHHHH, he's so handsome! Oh, Bob, our daughter's finally found a handsome rainicorn to love!
X: You think I'm a rainicorn?
X: I think we can spot a member of our own species, Jake. We're not blind.
X: Well, we are a little blind.
X: Yes, I guess we are a little blind.
X: Uh, well, hey! Come on in! It's awesome to finally meet you both!
X: Your house is very colorful. I like that!
X: Haha! The plan is working, homie!
X: Jake, what is that thing that's talking?
X: Uh... that's um...
X: I'm Jake's rainicorn roommate! Everyone do the traditional rainicorn rain dance!
X: Jake, please ask your goblin butler to stop insulting my heritage!
X: Uh... y-yes! Get outta here, goblin! Go fetch us some rainicorn snacks!
X: But—
X: Come on, homie, help me!
X: Ha! You got it, homie!
X: Uh... please, c-come upstairs.
X: My goblin will bring us snacks in a moment.
X: Thank you, Jake. I'm glad the wife and I made the trip from the Crystal Dimension.
X: Yes, we're eager to know more about the studly young rainicorn that's dating our daughter.
X: Ethel...
X: Well, ask me whatever you like, Ethel, Bob!
X: I am a little curious about your goblin. He looks a little odd.
X: Well... he's actually a human.
X: Oh, Bob! Our future-son-in-law must be filthy-rich to afford a human butler!
X: Shh. Thank you, Jake, for being interested in our daughter!
X: Uh... No problem, Bob!
X: Oh! Let's play some traditional rainicorn games!
X: Jake, do you know Cameladabalawabapp?
X: Uh, s-say it again?
X: Cameladabalawabapp!
X: Ohhhh! ! Ha! Y'all should go first, though.
X: Hmm. Bold move letting your opponent move first, Jake. I respect that. Very well. Cameladabalawabapp!!
X: Oh, Bob!
X: Haha! Your turn, Jake!
X: I...
X: Snacks! Get your snacks!
X: Dude! I have to show Lady's parents that I have rainbow powers! I need homie help!
X: Hmm... I got a plan, bro-ham. Just stretch your horn at me, and I'll take care of the rest.
X: You're the best, homie.
X: Homies help homies.
X: Haha! !
X: Very unusual color palette, Jake.
X: Yes. Subtle.
X: Whoo! Oh, yeah! Finn?
X: How about we play some more traditional rainicorn games, my boy?
X: I, uh... Oh. Um... let's do it!
X: Let the games begin!
X: I'm sorry.
X: Hey, man. How's it goin'?
X: IT'S "GOING" CRUD-COW!
X: I know, I know, I'm sorry. But they really like me. Your plan is working perfectly!
X: Being poked in the buns and laughed at was not in my plan! Not in the plan!
X: Look, Finn, you know I got yo back fo'-eva', but right now, you're the only one who can help me. Come on, homie. Hey, guys. You ready to get this game goin' again?
X: Oh, no, we're pooped.
X: Yeah, we're about ready to break out our picnic basket and dig in!
X: Wohhh, no. You're my guests. Let me take care of you. Homie... help me cook something, please.
X: ...Okay.
X: Thanks, Finn. Okay. Don't worry about a thing. Finn'll make a great lunch. He's a little raw, but he's got great taste.
X: What?! Wow! So wealthy, and so generous!
X: Ah! I was hoping! I was afraid to ask!
X: WAAAH! Jake!! I think they wanna eat me!!
X: Of course we do! Jake said you'd "make a great lunch"!
X: JAKE! COME ON!
X: Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man....
X: AAAH! Knock it off, Bob!!
X: Don't you touch him!!
X: Come on, stop it, guys! Come on, y'all, I said stop!
X: You're a dog?
X: Yeah, I just... Look, I'm sorry about everything. I was—
X: YAAAAAY! HA-HEEEY! HURRAAAAY!
X: Uh... uh... Lady?!
X: 어, 나도 우리 부모님 때문에 걱정했었어! 우리 엄마아빠는 개라면 완전 맛이 가거든! 개가 전쟁터에서 우리 아빠 생명을 구해줬었어! ("Oh, I was worried about my parents! My mom and dad are crazy about dogs! A dog saved my dad in the war!")
X: What did she say?
X: She said she worried that they'd freak out... 'cause her parents are bananas for dogs!
X: J.J. FLIP! What the zip?!
X: Yeah! She says a dog saved her dad in the war!
X: Wow! That's flippin' awesome.
X: Finn.
X: ...Wha?
X: Listen, I just want you to know how sorry we are about... trying to eat you.
X: It's just we thought we'd never get another chance. We thought humans were extinct.
X: Oh.
X: So... this isn't human?
X: Oh, no. This is soy people!
X: Oh.
X: I've never tasted real human before, but they say you can't even tell the difference!
X: Ew... Soy? FINN, YOU'RE DELICIOUS!


=== S2E16 ===
X: Haha! Time to protect the sun!
X: Ha ha! Yeah, he knows how to get things started.
X: Firepit number 1. Easy-peasy, livin' greasy! You wonder why they even put it there.
X: It's probably a computel gleetch.
X: Now comes some real trouble! It's Bouncy Bee! He's gonna get that sun, man!
X: Haha! Please. Bleep!
X: I had my eyes closed on that one!
X: Yeah, that was cool. Oh, oh, you missed a coin, dude, go back!
X: I ain't in it for the money, man. I'm in it to crush the enemies of the sun. Like this sloppy butt right here.
X: Hunny Bunny!
X: I'm like, Hunny Bunny, don't you ever learn? I've always got the bomba!
X: Man, you are hot tonight! Think you can do it this time? Can you beat Sleepy Sam?!
X: Oh, I very can!
X: use a combo move!
X: Okay! Here goes.
X: Up, down, left, left, right, right, down-
X: Spin, down, up, left, faster, dude! Right, left, down!
X: Aww! Every time! BMO, this game is the worst! If we were really inside that game, man, we would crush Sleepy Sam. Breezily! With my mitts!
BMO: Oh no! It's much more dangerous than you think!
X: Whoa, whoa, wait!
X: BMO, is there a way for us to get in the game for real?
BMO: Yes, of course, Jake. If I push this button-
BMO: If I push this button, you will both be dangerously transported into my main brain game frame where it is very dangerous!
X: Oh, man. Oh, BMO! You gotta let us in that game!
BMO: No! It's a far too dangerous incredible adventure for you! It's final.
X: Oh. Okay, BMO. Well, time for bed!
X: ...Finn?
X: Time for bed. Right, Jake?
X: ...oh, right! Heh heh. Good night, BMO.
X: We're in the game!
X: Look! There's the sunshine we gotta protect!
X:  I'm looking at my bits! My leg is math!
X:  Mmm. That sunshine feels good. Feels good all over!
X:  No wonder all the monsters in this game want to get their grubby mitts on it! Let's go kick their digital bootays! Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo doo! Doo!
X: Beep boop! Beep boop!
X:  ♫ We are in the computer world. We're computer boys, not computer girls. ♫
X:  ♫ In a game, I can be who I virtually am. ♫
X:  ♫ I can walk and sing, I can kill Silly Sam! ♫
X:   Smells like...
X:  Pit! Looks a mite bigger inside the game...
X:  Jumpin' over this pit is easy, remember? We could do this backwards with our eyes closed! Ahh! I'm burning!
X:  Jake!!
X:  Haha. What, man?
X: Whaa?! Jake, what the shake?
X:  Check it out! Extra lives!
X:  You still have two left!
X:   Ow! It burns! Ow! Haha!
X:  Jake!
X:  Dude! What if losing all your lives in here makes you die in real life? Or worse?!
X:  ...that makes me just want to sit here and feel bad.
X:  No way, man! We're gonna cross that hole! With real-world grit! Come on!
X:  Faster, Jake! Get ready to stretch it!
X:  Watch out, Jake!
X:  Ow! Whew! That was pretty intense, dude!
X:  We're pretty intense dudes!
X:  Yeah!
X:  Ha!
X:  What's that sound?
X:  Sounds like...
X:  Bouncy Bee!
X:  Whoa!
X:  Hi-yah!
X:  You ready to flippin' this guy up, Jake?
X:  Easy-peasy, livin' greasy!
X:  No!
X:  Finn's dead! Finn! No! Oh, Finn!
X: Yo, what up?
X:  Oh, Finn! You're alive!
X:  Yeah. I got extra lives, man!
X:  Oh my gosh. Let's never die again! There's nothing more precious than a life! Ooh, dude, look. Coins! Oh man, oh man! Ooh! Oh, man, dude, these coins are thick! Let's take 'em back to the real world! We'll be filthy stinkin' rich!
X:  Whoa!
X:  Hunny Bunny!
X:  No!
X:  Time to use the bomba! Oh, bomba! I can't select you without my controller!
X:  Let's get outta here, Finn!
X:  Man, we've never run away from Hunny Bunny!
X:  Firepit, Bouncy Bee, Hunny Bunny. They're supposed to be the easy parts! They're all hard as butts! Sleepy Sam is gonna be the ultimate butt-kicker!
X:  Look, Finn. The most important thing to remember is that I still have one giant coin.
X:  Man, get a hold of your brains! We need to stay alert for Sleepy Sam!
X:  Hey, that's him right there!
X:  Get down! I'm gonna break you, Sam. When I'm done, they'll call you...uh, Stinky Sam. Stupid Frog.
X:   M-m-my mitts didn't- didn't work! Come on, help me punch him!
X:  Okay!
X:  Let's get outta here, man! We're gonna die!
X:  I can see the light! We're almost there!
X:  Oh no, man. It's the edge of the screen! We're trapped and they'll be here any second.
X:  Wait, dude! The bomba!
X:  We can't get the bomba!
X:  Wait, dude. Hmm.
X:  Jake? Jake!
X:  What if I...?
X:  That's not how it works!
X:  Jake, let go of that!
X:   But we need the bomba!
X:  Finn!
X:  Oh, holy cow! That was nuts, man!
X:  Yeah, man. And I got my coin! Oh no! Are you alright buddy?
BMO:   Did you have to- oh no! Wait! Run!
X:  No, no, no! Don't kill us, man! No!
X:  Aw man, don't kill us! We don't have extra lives!
X:  Oh wait. Hold up, guys. Check it out! Sunshine!
X:  Oh boy, that feels good!
X:  Alright! See ya later, Sam!
X:  You mean, that's it? You're not gonna kill us?
X:   Of course not. The game's over; we won! All we wanted was the sunshine. And to kill that computer that's been imprisoning us for so many years.
X:  ...what?
BMO:  Help! Oh no!
X:  BMO!
X:  Oh sure. He's dangerous! If he hits his button again, back we go.
X:  BMO, quick! Hit your button!
BMO:  I can't, Finn! I'm stuck!
X:  You want him to hit his button? What's wrong with you?!
X:  We'll save you, BMO! Finn, go!
BMO:  They're too strong! Use the combo move, Finn! The combo-
X:  The combo move? That never works!
X:  Listen! You got this, man! I know you-
X:   Up! Down! Left! Left! Right! Right! Down! Spin! Down! Up! Left! Right! Left! Down! Spin! Up! Down! Jump!!
X:  Whoa.
X:  Woohoo! You did it, Finn! I knew you had the stuff! Right, BMO?
X:  Oh, crud!
X:  BMO!
X:  I'm sorry, buddy!
BMO:  Finn, I told you about the danger! And now look! You fricasseed my stuff and broke our house all up!
X:  I know, I know. I was double butt. For real. Man! Now that we know what to expect, next time will be way more fun!
X:  Yeah, yeah!
X:  How 'bout it, BMO? You in?
X:  Hey! Don't do the combo move on us!
X:  We were only joking!
X:  BMO! Stop messing around!


=== S2E23 ===
X: Don't forget LSP's diet cola.
X: I won't. I really do love Finn and Jake Movie Club.
X: Okay, everybody. Apple juice for Tree Trunks. Diet soda for LSP.
X: Ehh.
X: What did you order, PB?
X: Oh, I brought my own.
X: Huh.
X: Ice latte for my lady.
X: Tomato juice for Marceline.
X: Thanks, Finn.
X: Hot cocoa for BMO.
BMO: This does compute.
X: And finally, a thimble of milk for Shelby, the worm who lives in Jake's viola.
X: You can just call me Shelby.
X: Jake...
X: We're so excited that you could be here tonight for Finn and Jake's Movie Club's feature presentation...
X: Heat Signature 3.
X: Oh, with the submarine?
X: Sounds great.
X: 재밌겠는데? (It looks like funny)
X: Get on with it!
X: Princess Bubblegum's in my seat.
X: No reserved seating. First come, first served.
X: Grr.
X: What's that?
X: Just stuff that comes at the beginning of the movies.
X: Yeah, that's on all the movies we dig up.
X: I don't know. It seems pretty important, Finn.
X: Alright, let's take a look.
X: Pause, BMO.
X: "Warning. Federal law provides severe and criminal penalties for the unauthorized exhibition of copyrighted motion pictures."
X: Alright, well, goodbye.
X: Sorry we had to cancel.
X: We've been showing these films unauthorized.
X: But these movies are before the Great Mushroom War.
X: We should still respect authority, mang.
X: Yeah?
X: Are we meeting next week to watch a movie?
X: Uhh... Uh, yeah. Maybe. I think so.
X: Finn, don't cancel movie club! I've literally been having the time of my life.
X: 아, 너무 좋았는데. ("Oh, I enjoyed that so much!")
X: Calm down, y'all. We're gonna have Finn and Jake Movie Club next week for sure. Jake and I just have to find a movie without that warning.
X: Dude, we've never found a movie without that warning.
X: We're not gonna find a movie, Jake.
X: Well, what are we gonna do?
X: We're gonna make one!
X: Wowp!
X: Movie filming time!
X: Okay, BMO. Turn to your right, and start filming.
X: Start to truck in. Keep going. Keep truckin' in, BMO.
X: Huh?
X: That was awesome, BMO.
X: Yeah. Fantastic, super.
X: Don't lose her, BMO!
X: Front shot! Front shot! Film the clouds. Don't forget the little one.
X: BMO! BMO, you're gonna miss it! Over there to your right.
X: Oh, we're gonna miss it. Hurry, BMO!
X: Don't lose it. Oh, it looks like it's gonna fall. Follow it!
X: Look over there. Across the river.
X: BMO, forget about the coin. Film that over there!
X: Zoom in. Weird. Let's get some more footage.
X: Like that?
X: Yeah, perfect.
X: Are you, are you sure?
X: Yeah, look great.
X: W-w-wait. How about this?
X: That's even better!
X: Uhh, what do you think?
X: I don't get it. It's just a bunch of random junk.
X: Yeah, I'm not engaged. I need to see something that reflects life as it is, but, you know, entertaining.
X: Yeah, like a romantic comedy.
X: Exactly. An action adventure.
X: Wait, that's not what I said.
X: Let's get to filming!
X: Okay, Slime Princess! In this scene, you're gonna leap over to that vine, swim over the crocodiles, do a triple flip with a full twist and land clean. Don't fall in the water, or you'll get eaten alive. Action!
X: No! No smooching! Cut.
X: I thought it was great.
X: No, we can't use any of it.
X: I think we should use all of it.
X: No, not all. We should throw away the parts where Slime Princess was smoochin'. That was dumb.
X: What?
X: Duuuumb-ah.
X: Okay, you're having a picnic, you're in love but you can't admit it. So you're having a playful food fight. And action.
X: Why did you do that?
X: Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut, that was not what I wanted!
X: That was awesome! We need to shoot more stuff like that.
X: What's next?
X: Okay PB, move back a little.
X: Finn.
X: Yeah.
X: How does this work?
X: Umm, Jake's gonna get the frog to hop toward him and when he does, you're gonna run along side the chariot and it's gonna look like you're driving it.
X: Okay.
X: Hey, Finn.
X: Yeah.
X: How 'bout when the chariot takes off, she says something like, "Mmm, check, please."
X: What? No, that's terrible. And action!
X: Check, please...?
X: Hah, Jake. You... you brought the fly in too close!
X: I'm sorry.
X: Well, help me catch 'im.
X: Well, I thought it was funny.
X: This isn't a comedy!
X: Not the way you're shootin' it.
X: Look, just help me catch this guy.
X: All right, but after this we do my part.
X: . But we are makin' a movie, and this is the big wedding scene. Mr. Cupcake, you're playing Todd Johnson.
X: Yes.
X: And Lady, you confess that you never loved Todd Johnson and that you were just trying to win a bet with your snooty socialite friends.
X: 알았어, 제이크. ("Okay, Jake.")
X: And then, you both realize you do love each other and you both say "I do." And then Shelby, you say...
X: Check, please.
X: Heh, heh, heh. Yeah. Don't forget to look right at the camera and slap your cheeks like this. And 1, 2, 3 action!
X: Do you, Todd Johnson, take this Rainicorn to be your lawfully married wife?
X: Lady! Cut! Cut, cut, cut! I didn't tell you to flex out!
X: 자기야, 흥분하지 마. ("Don't take it seriously, honey.")
X: No, I don't like the way he's flexing at you.
X: I don't hear her complaining.
X: Why you... GAAH!
X: Check, please.
X: How much longer till you finish editing, BMO?
BMO: About twenty hours.
X: Twenty hours?!
BMO: Yeah, you guys shot a lot of footage. About twenty hours.
X: Jake, let's talk about our movie.
X: Okay.
X: I think we shot a lot of great stuff.
X: Uh-huh.
X: But I'm thinkin' only half of it is usable.
X: Me, too.
X: Really?
X: Yeah, I was just thinking that.
X: That's great!
X: I know.
X: You actually agree it's an action adventure!
X: Yep, it—wait! No!
X: What?
X: Romantic comedy!
X: What?!
X: What do you mean "what"?!
X: Who's right, BMO?
X: Yeah, me or Finn?
X: We'll ask him when he wakes up.
X: Why wait? "Dear BMO, Please use only the best footage when cutting the movie. Love, Jake."
X: "And Finn."
X: See you at the movie club, then.
X: Oh, I'll be there.
X: As will I.
X: As will I, as well.
X: Yes. Oh, yes. Oh, I can't wait. Oh, I can't wait!
X: Heh heh. Alright, thanks again everyone for coming to... movie night! I hope y'all are in the mood to laugh.
X: I hope y'all are ready to be on the edge of your seats for tonight's action adventure film.
X: It's, ahh, it's more of a romantic comedy. Right, BMO?
BMO: Eeee...
X: Well, I guess we'll see!
X: Yeah, I guess we will. Start the movie, BMO.
X: It's a little awkward.
X: Oh, my gosh!
X: BMO's right. Fighting over this movie junk is dumb. I'm sorry, man.
X: Me too, dude.
X: Oh, my gosh, you guys. I can't wait till next week's movie club.
BMO: Check, please.
X: That's a good one, BMO!


=== S3E1 ===
X: Yeeeaaah!
X: What's for B-fast, Jake?
X: Everything burrito!
X: Jake! Come on! Get ready!
X: Ready!
X: Yaaaaah!
X: Peep!
X: So cute!
X: Look at their little faces! Haha!
X: Haha!
X: We're not cute! We're evil, ...and we're here to dominate you!
X: Get the camera, Jake!
X: I can't! I'm paralyzed by the cuteness!
X: BMO! BMO! BMO! BMO!
BMO: What? What? What? What?
X: BMO! Get the camera!
BMO: BMO is camera!
X: Enough! Now... bow down to me, Cute King, and my legion of Cuties!
X: Great shot, BMO!
X: Since you won't take us seriously, we will kill you. Until then, enjoy your burrito, Jake.
X: Huh?
X: My burrito!
X: It's perfectly fine.
X: No, Finn... They probably poisoned it!
X: Naaaaawww...
X: They knew my name. They knew about the burrito.
X: Man, you're letting your brain dial turn your fear volume up. You'll see. Those Cuties are nothing but an afternoon's delight.
X: Jake? What're you doing in my bed?
X: Oh, nothing much. You know, just... chillin'.
X: Wait a second... Are you still messed up about those little guys?
X: A little.
X: Look, man, whaddaya say tomorrow morning we go track those little guys down and find out just what their deal is? Sound good, buddy?
X: Yeah. Thanks, buddy. Man, you sound just like Mom sometimes.
X: Yeah. Good ol' Mom.
X: She always knew just what to say.
X: Yeah. Goodnight, brudda.
X: Goodnight. Finn, wake up, man!
X: Wha? Huh?
X: I think someone's in the house. For real, man! Shh, listen.
X: Uh...
X: I swear, man! I really heard something. Finn!!
X: I heard. Okay. Who's out there?
X: What the—?! That's my sword! It came from downstairs.
X: Alright. That's it.
X: Where are you going?
X: I'm gonna go man-handle those guys's banandles!
X: Well, they broke a window, but I don't see any of 'em.
X: Oh, no. OH, AWWW, NO!
X: Jake, what is it?!
X: Ah, no, wait, it's just a blanket. I think I left it here this morning.
X: Jaaaake! Fiiiinn! This is the voice of your moooom! I've come back to tell you how dumb you always aaaare! I hate you guys so muuuuch!
X: Get 'im, Jake!
X: Aaah! Aaah!
X: Jake, I got 'im! He's freakin' out, man! What do I do?!
X: Shake 'im!
X: What?!
X: Shake 'im around 'til he stops!
X: Okay. They stopped.
X: Okay. Now tell 'im not to talk about our mom!
X: How do you even know our mom?
X: We've been watching you.
X: Learning your weaknesses.
X: What?! Why?!
X: For tomorrow morning.
X: When our army comes and kills you both.
X: You think we're so cute, when actually... we're the opposite of that!!
X: Hold 'im!
X: Oh, gross.
X: Well?! Do you believe me now, Finn?!
X: I... I don't know what to believe anymore.
X: Well, that's close enough. Let's start settin' up some barricades!
X: There's gotta be a thousand of 'em!
X: Wait. Jake, look.
X: These guys aren't a threat to anyone.
X: These guys are a threat to themselves.
X: Oh, hey, it's what's-his-face!
X: No... My men! Quickly, men! Pick yourselves up before the enemy sees!
X: Wanna just smash 'em all?
X: What?! No, man, look. These guys aren't gonna quit until they win or die, ...and they're not gonna win, so what if we let 'em win, just this once?
X: What?! And mess up my stats?!
X: No. We'd be winning by helping them to win. That's a win! And then they'll be happy and leave us alone.
X: Alright.
X: Yessss! Now, let's rally an army so we can look intimidating.
X: Who're we gonna call?
X: All of our friends.
X: My army of friends! Today, we will lose this battle, but we will also win it! When the enemy charges, crumble like a cookie. When you feel their puny punches, fade like a flower, and writhe in your own blood!
BMO: But, but... how are we to bleed if none of this is real?
X: With faith, m'lady... and ketchup!
X: Ketchup is delicious and deceiving!
X: And hey, guys... Let's keep the acting subtle. Less is more.
X: No way. First, I'm gonna fall in love with one of those little guys, and then I'm gonna fall out of love, and then, I'm gonna totally fake-die of a fake heart attack! "OH! MY HEART! MY HEART HURTS BECAUSE I FELL OUT OF LOVE! AND NOW I HAVE TO DIE! OOOOHHHHH!!!"
X: Get ready, y'all. Together, we fall!
X: Not yet, Cinnamon Bun!
X: YAAAAH!
X: Whoa.
X: Oh, no!
X: I'm dead.
X: Victory... is... OURS!
X: BAAAHAHAHAHAHA! Ah, I'm sorry, everybody! Ah, I couldn't keep it in! Hahahaha!
X: No... This is ketchup?!
X: Tastes better than blood. Or does it? Hey, Finn, you think blood tastes better than ketchup?
X: Jake. Look.
X: Aw, nuts.
X: Cute King, wait up.
X: We wanna apologize for being fakers.
X: We did it to protect you from yourselves.
X: It doesn't matter now. No one will ever fear our strength.
X: But strength isn't your strength. Adorable cuteness is!
X: Can I use it to control others?
X: Um... yeah, sure! Just be righteous about it.
X: Show me where to start.
X: Huh? Who could that be?
X: I command you to make me a sandwich!
X: What?! No one commands the Ice King to make no sandwich!
X: What about now?
X: Okay.


=== S3E5 ===
X: Finn? Finn? Finn! Where are you? I need you to try this!
X: I'll be there in a sec!
X: What's the status?
X: Good, man!
X: Nice! Seal the deal, bro!
X: Okay, man! Whatevs!
X: You can do it, you hear me?!
BMO: How's Finn's date?
X: I think it's goin' good.
BMO: Unlike your game, boiiiii!
X: Where's the key to the tower, BMO?! Tell me! AAAGH!
X: Okay, Finn. She's 13; you're 13. Just have fun! Be yourself. Wooooo!
X: What's that? Are you trying to make yourself 18 again?
X: Nah. This is an instant bath serum. It makes you sweat cleaning agents.
X: I don't bathe. I want that!
X: WAAAUGH! Hot, hot, oh—WAAAAUGH! Oh... so spice! So spice!
X: YOU'RE so spice!
X: Bwaaa bwaaa bwaaaaaa! Announcing the arrival of the Earl of Lemongrab!
X: Heh hah hah- AAAAUGH! Oof! Ha ha ha!
X: This castle is... in... UNACCEPTABLE CONDITIIIIOOOON! UNACCEPTABLLLEEE!
X: Thirty days in the dungeon!
X: For who?
X: Everyone in this ROOM! MMMLLUUUUUGH!!!
X: Wait, wait! You can't give orders like that! I'm in charge here, Lemongrab!
X: TOO YOUNG! TOO YOUNG TO RULE THE KINGDOM!
X: Watch your manners with the princess--!
X: HHHHUUUUOOOOOOOOOOOH?!
X: What the huh?
X: MMMM! I am next in line to thee throne! Sooo... I will be in charge... UNTIL PRINCESS BUBBLEGUM turns... 18 again!
X: That's bunk! Right, Preebos?
X: No... He is rightful ruler under kingdom law. It's complicated. I created Lemongrab.
X: He was the first of my experiments gone wrong...
X: Nnnnnnuh!
X: Gaaaaaah!
X: EEEEEEAAAAAAGH!
X: ... And now that I'm younger than him, he inherits the right to the throne.
X: IF ANYONE NEEDS ME I'LL BE TAKING A NAP! A...a-a-and CLEAN this place up or dungeon! THREE HOURS DUNGEON!
X: Who are you talking to?!
X: THREE! HOURS! DUNGEON!
X: NNNNOOOOOOOO!!!
X: We'll see you in a few hours... okay, Starchie?
X: Yeah, right... If Starchie ever survives that long...
X: Finn, this is dirt balls! We gotta do something to make him leave!
X: Yeah... like pranking him up his face!
X: Hey, yeah! And I have the perfect prank! C'mon, Finn!
X: "You... really... smell... like... ... dog buns"...?
X: NNNUUUUuuuuuooooooooooOOOOOOOOUUUUUUGGGGHHH!!!
X: Well, well, well... IS THIS EVERYONE, THEN?!
X: Yes, all the castle staff.
X: Sooo which one of yooou WAS it?! Who did... the THING?!
X: The... thing?
X: THE THING, THE THING!!!
X: Hey, man! Calm down! It's just a prank, man! For laughs!
X: Prank? F... for... laughs? HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH- OH! HAOAHOAHAOAHOAHAOAHAOHAO
X: Heh, heh...
X: C'mon... LET'S MOVE IT!!!
X: I don't think that worked out too math, Finn.
X: What? No, no! He just needs some more prankin's to finish the job! He'll leave the kingdom. Let's try it my way this time, okay?
X: Okay!
X: OOF!
X: Keep 'em coming! I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!!! Ho... ha... Ah-ah-oooow!
X: I got a new plan!
X: Oh, yeah? What?
X: We'll work together and use that serum you made. The one that was "Ah! So Spice!" And spice-bomb him non-stop 'till his butt falls out! How's that sound?
X: Hoooo!
X: Thank you for releasing me early from the dungeon, Master Lemongrab.
X: I determine what is early, and what is late, Mr. Peppermint!
X: Yes, Your Earlness.
X: Also... I don't know where food comes from!
X: My Lord, food comes from Ma--
X: AHHHHtatatataNO!! That's why I am royal and you are servile!
X: You ready to pour the stuff?
X: Yeah! I made it super-hot this time!
X: Wait 'till he opens the lid!
X: a plate of mashed carrots, flavor--
X: Shoot!
X: HHHHAAAAAAA!!! HAAAAAAA! HAAAAAAA!!!! AAAAAAAGHAAA!!!!!
X: Shh!
X: STOP SCREAMING!!! WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING?!
X: Because I'm excited by this meal I made!
X: Me, too. I'm excited, too.
X: HHHHUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
X: He's eating the dirt! SPICE IT NOW!
X: He's heading for the orchard!
X: Apple!
X: Mmmm!
X: Heh, heh... heh!
X: OOOOOONE MILLION YEEEEEEEARS, DUNGEON!!!!
X: Maybe if we... set his butt on fire.
X: No, Finn... There's only one way. I just didn't want to have to do it. If I change myself back to my real age, I can reclaim the throne.
X: What? No! I mean... you can do that?
X: Then... why did you wait so long?
X: Because being 13 again is... Bloobaloobie!
X: Hm?
X: While being 18 is all plock dumps and wagglezags... I never really get to act like a kid. But, it's okay. Really. My people need me, and that comes first!
X: Yeaaah...
X: First thing we need is more candy flesh to increase my biomass. But I need my lab equipment to engineer it.
X: Not necessarily, milady!
X: Oh, thank you! Thank you, all! Okay... Next we need a bonding agent.
X: Princess? I think I can help.
X: Finished!
X: There's one last thing we need. Only the heat from a whopping love hug can catalyze the re-age-ifying process.
X: Are you ready, Princess?
X: Yes, Finn. But... first, I just want to say how much fun I've had hanging out with you.
X: Me, too!
X: And I... I wish I could stay... like this, with you, but--
X: I... I know, Princess.
X: 'Scuse, me, Finn. Yo, Earl!
X: WHAAAAAT?!
X: Hey! You're fired, ya BUTT!
X: HHHHHRRRRRGGGRRRUUGGHHH!!!!!
X: I'm so glad everything's back to normal. Thanks for all your help, Finn.
X: Oh- you're welcome! But... uhm...
X: What is it, Finn?
X: Well, ah... Do you... do you wanna hug some more?
X: What? Finn, you silly! That was, like, five years ago! You really gotta move on.
X: Oh- yeah, yeah... Sorry...
X: Such a silly boy.
X: Hello?
X: Hey, man! What's the status?
X: Bad news, man... I... I got dumped.
X: Awww. I'm sorry, Finn. But look, man. Lemme share with you a little secret on how to win the heart of a princess. It's not easy, but ya have to be persistent. You might have to defeat a demon lord, and warp through several worlds.
X: But once you do, you walk up the wizard stairs, and produce your magic key you got in a water world and unlock the chamber door. Then, walk right up to the princess, and give her a smooch.
X: Yesss! Does that make sense?
X: Yeah, man. I see what you're sayin'. Thanks, Jake.
X: Mmm-hmm.
X: Go up the wizard steps.
Episode ends.


=== S3E10 ===
X: Jake? BMO?
X: Hey, man, what you doing?!
X: Dude!
X: Don't worry, bro. We won't tell anyone about the private time you spend with your wad of Princess Bubblegum's hair.
X: You guys knew?
X: Finn, we're roommates. Which is why I'm gonna share my beloved keepsake with you.
X: Babadadaa! My old baby blanket.
X: Hmmm! Hmmhmmhmmhmm!
X: Who are you?
X: Hmm hmm hmm hmm!
X: Hmmhmmhmm.
BMO: Noooo!
X: Hmmhmm!
X: Come on!
X: I'll get your kid back, toy!
X: Hmmhmmph!
X: That guy must do crazy squats.
X: Get back here, you thieving Door Lord! You butt!
X: Come on, Bubblegum!
X: Finn?
X: Marceline! Are you okay?!
X: Yeah.
X: Don't worry. We'll get him.
X: No!
X: It's the door of the Door Lord, Finn. We used to lock them up, but they kept breaking out. 'Cause they're Door Lords.
X: They broke out because you let them live.
X: Hmm? The door said it will open for a genuine band. Let's try and music this door open as a quintet.
X: Can I be the jerk in the band? 'Cause that's an important part of a band's success. Hmph.
X: I know how to get through this door. We're gonna lay down a chill jam.
X: Hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah!
X: Just keep it cool. Got that princess?
X: Hmph.
BMO: Ohh! Oh, my face!
X: Let's see if you hacks can keep up with my raw talent!
X: It's working! Look at the door!
X: ...To bury you in the ground... and drink the blood from your... Ugh!
X: Stop staring at me! Ugh, you threw me off!
X: Come on, everybody! Don't stop now. The door was responding to our music! I wonder what it liked or what was missing.
X: Well, I know what's missing. Talent. I'm getting out of here, you hacks! Talentless hacks!
X: Yikes.
X: Let's take a noodle break. Come on, it will help!
X: No! Wait, don't go, too!
X: I'm just gonna get stuff to cook that.
X: Cook?
X: That was sweet what you said about being buds.
X: Mm-hmm. Thanks.
BMO: Oh.
X: For our next attempt, I wanna be the lead.
X: Yeah! Sounds cool, my bud.
X: Hmph!
X: Jake, you're back!
X: Shut yo' face. I came back for the music.
X: BMO, execute Sound Structure Alpha. Marceline, begin playing triplet quavers in mixolydian mode.
X: Alright, fine. Wait, what's a quaver?
X: Now, Finn, vibrate your uvula by dampening and undampening your larynx.
X: Wha?
X: Go like this, silly.
X: Oh. Whaaaa...
X: Okay, okay. Jake, are you gonna join in?
X: Everyone, just stick to my blueprints.
BMO: Oohh...
X: One more time?
X: I may have, um... miscalculated.
X: Ha! Looks like you aren't as perfect as you thought. Guess you can't judge me anymore.
X: I never said you had to be perfect!
X: Alright, time out, guys.
X: Princess! Princess, wait!
X: Marceline?
X: I'm just pretending!
X: Jake! Everybody! We can beat the Door Lord! ...Together.
X: Hmm? Hmmhmmhmm!
X: It's over, Door Lord.
X: So hand over our stuff.
X: Hmmhmmhmmhmm. Hmmhmmhmm hmmhmmhmmhmm hmmhmm hmmhmmhmmhmm. Hmm!
X: What's he trying to say?
X: I totally get it. He may have stolen our treasures...
X: ...But by doing so, he showed us...
X: ...That the real treasure is friendship.
X: Mmmhmmhmm! Mmmhmm hmmhmmhmm.
X: Hmm...
X: Okay, here's that lock of Bubblegum's hair you love so much.
X: Oh, you.
X: Ah, yeesh.
X: And here's Jakey's blankey. Here's your controller, BMO.
BMO: Yippie ki-yi-yay!
X: Marceline, here's your rock shirt.
X: Hey, that's not...
X: It's mine! That's mine.
X: You... kept the shirt I gave you?
X: Yeah. It, uh, means a lot to me.
X: But you never wore it.
X: Dude, I wear it all the time... as pajamas.
X: Wait, if that's Bubblegum's shirt, what are you missing, Marceline?
X: Wait a second, wait a second! You don't have a thing! You just wanted to hang out with us!
X: No, I didn't!
X: No way, you're caught! I figured you out!
X: I'll kill you!


=== S3E12 ===
X: This stinks! Hey, how much longer till we get to the mysterious party?
X: Let me check the spooky invite sent to us by our anonymous host. Oh. We're here. The party's in that castle.
X: It's for us!
X: What's it say?
X: Wear me.
X: Wear me?
X: Hello?
X: Yoo-hoo! Hey guys!
X: Princess Bubblegum, is that you?
X: Why yes indeed. Although according to the invitation, we're supposed to use mystery names. And mine is Lady Quietbottom.
X: My name is Duchess Gummybuns.
BMO: I am Professor Pants.
X: I'm Cinnamon Bun.
X: What's the name on your invite?
X: Oh yeah! Uh... It's Guy Farting.
X: Prince Hotbod, at your service.
X: I'm Randy Butternubs.
X: So... who's our host, anyway?
X: Nobody knows!
X: Maybe he'll be a steaming hot babe with huge money.
X: Tut-tut, Lumpy Space Princess! What would your boyfriend Brad say?
X: Brad and I broke up a long time ago, duh!
X: Now's my chance!
X: No. Way.
X: But I can make you happy!
X: You big donut!
X: Okay.
X: Excuse me, Guy Farting, there's an envelope on your back.
X: Where? Where?
X: Here. Let me.
X: Did you put that enevlope on him?
X: No.
X: No. I didn't do it, no.
BMO: No. Uh-Uh.
X: What's it say, Prince Hotbod?
X: Esteemed guests, I am your host. I am a ghost.
X: By the time you finish reading this, I will posses one of you and use your body to murder everyone in the house.
X: We gotta get out of here!
X: CB, wait! It says anyone who will try to leave will die!
X: Nonononononono!
X: He's DEAD!!!
X: Yeaaaaah, right.
X: Whad'ya mean "Yeaaaah, right"?
X: To make you think everyone was dead.
X: It looks real to me.
X: Classic move.
X: Dude. I swear I'm not pranking you. Cinnamon Bun is dead.
X: who killed him?
X: One of us is possessed by a murderer. And if we want to stay alive, we have to figure out who's hiding a ghost inside their mortal body.
X: BMO!
BMO: Ahh!
X: Use your ghost detecting equipment to screen everyone.
X: I blinked by balls. My eye balls.
BMO: Hmmm...
X: What do you mean "Hmmm?"
BMO: Nothing...
X: Did you see that?
X: Oh it was Jake I knew it, I knew it was Jake.
BMO: Processing... Data!
X: Ew.
X: Huh?
X: So who's the ghost, BMO?
BMO: Oh. Um... I don't have a ghost detecting equipment. I just like taking nice pictures.
X: Let's find some candles. If the lights go out again, we'll be able to catch the murderer!
X: Good idea! Jake and BMO, you check downstairs and we'll take this floor.
X: Okay.
X: Lay truth on me BMO, is Finn pulling some elaborate prank on me?
BMO: No, Jake. When bad things happen, I know you want to believe they are a joke. Found it!
X: Ooh! Thanks, BMO! BMO?
BMO: Help!
BMO: Jake help!
X: BMO?
X: AHHH! Oh my crease! Oh my crease! Assemble! Reassemble! Come on you guys!
X: Where's BMO?
X: The ghost got 'im!
X: Don't you mean you got 'im- Ghost!
X: Guys, if there really is a ghost killer, then we should stay in a group. He can't take us all on if we're in a group!
X: LSP, are you okay? Where are you?
X: I'm DYING!
X: Ahhh!
X: Ugh, gross. My lumping body's all hollow now, I gotta put something in it.
X: So where's the food? What kind of castle is this? It's like a poor people's castle! With no lumping waffles for my dump truck!
X: Chill out, girl. You find any candles upstairs?
X: No.
X: Well, I dropped a lighter downstairs, but there's no way I'm going back for that.
X: Uh-huh. Let me remind y'all that the invite says that the ghost will possess one of our bods.
X: Not my bod.
X: Someone at this table isn't who they appear to be!
X: "Jake."
X: So let me ask you a question only the real Jake could answer. Who is always next to me in my recurring elevator dreams?
X: A half-orc shaman.
X: Okay, you're Jake. So, who else was absent when BMO got nabbed?
X: Oh yeah, right! I'm not the ghost! I was in the potty house.
X: A convenient alibi. But tell me this...
X: Why did you break up with Brad? Only the real LSP would know that!
X: Shah! As if you even know the answer to that, Jake!
X: You're right. I'm just feeling gossipy and I wanna know what happened.
X: IT'S NONE OF YOUR LUMPING BUSINESS!
X: Sounds suspicious. I bet you're the ghost!
X: She did it! She's possessed! Tie her up!
X: Oh she is, huh? Well, before we tie up LSP, answer me this...
X: But answer me this, Princess...
X: What did I write to you on your Happy Birthday card two years ago? Word for word.
X: Finn, there's no way I would remember that...
X: You're not PB! Tie you up!
X: Look!
X: A real ghost?!
X: Aah! Don't touch me! Don't touch ME!
X: DAAAAAG!
X: This wasn't supposed to... ha-a-appen!
X: Aha! I knew you were pranking me back, you!
X: Yeah... it was all a set up. The doors, Cinnamon Bun's and BMO's. Oh strizz! BMO and Cinnamon Bun should be in the closet over there. Guys! Guys, guys! C'mon you guuuu-.
X: I'm calling my lumping parents right now!
X: LSP! What's happening!
X: Oh my Glob! I'm not ready! Get away! Oh, gross!
X: Where'd did she GO?!
X: I'm scared, bro.
X: RUN, HOMIE, RUN!
X: Open it!
X: It won't open!
X: C'mon!
X: Okay...
X: Jake!
X: Ow, ow, ow! I got a splinter!
X: Jakey!
X: Don't let go, man!
X: Oh no! Your fancy GLOVES!
X: Jake... Princess!
X: YEEAAARGH!
X: Haha! Gotcha, dude! Two for two!
X: WHAT!?
X: I figured out your plan months ago! So I flipped the script. Oh yeah!
X: So everyone's okay. BMO, Cinnamon Bun...
X: Yeah, see?!
X: Whoa, sick! You can phase people into your body?!
X: 당연하지! 난 제이크랑 항상 한 몸이 되는데. ("Of course. Jake and I merge our bodies all the time.")
X: I'm ready for you now, Brad. Isn't it so obvi? I'm so ready.
X: But, PB. You melted!
X: It was a wax dummy, dummy! Jake switched me out while Lady was distracting you.
X: Wow, you got me again! I can't believe that! With the hair, and the house coming alive and stuff...
X: The what?
X: The walls and chairs trying to eat me and stuff.
X: Eh, nah. You must have been so scared you imagined that part.
X: Uh, no I didn't...
X: Haha, nice try, Finn. Let's get outta here.
X: That one's going in the vault. Aaaaand... It's gone.


=== S3E19 ===
X: Jake... you made this?
X: Yeah!
X: And you buried the treasure right here?
X: Uh-huh.
X: Jake! You're awesome! So cool...
X: A suitcase?! Oh, man!
X: I found it at the dump and then buried it without lookin' inside.
X: Whoa. Wait a second, man. I know this case.
X: One night, while you were away at Lady's house, I was dancing in the woods...
X: Evil tapes! Evil!
X: Perchance I saw the Ice King doing something suspicious, so I trailed 'im to the dump, where he buried this case in the ground.
Ice King Wee, hahahahaha! Wee, hahahaha!
X: I waited for him to leave... but he played in those boogers for hours. I decided to come back later for the case... but I lost track of it.
X: Whoa! And I found it?
X: Mm-hmm.
X: Heh-heh-heh. Let's have a secret screening! I'll make some fliers for it!
X: There. Now nobody will bother us.
X: Jake! Jake, come on!
X: Okay. You can play this , right, BMO?
BMO: Yes, Finn. It goes in my butt!
X: Oh.
X: This is so exciting!
X: Hello, dear diary. Pretty good day so far. Got up bright and early and had a healthy and slimming breakfast, did fourteen minutes of cardio (and then I finally got around to)...
X: Dude... what are we watchin'?
X: I think it's the Ice King's diary.
X: ...I mean, I'm not gonna win carpenter of the year or anything, but it's a place to hang up the old toothbrush.
X: Wenk.
X: Gunther? Hey, Gunther. Get-get away from the camera, sweetie. Papa's recording his innermost thoughts. 'Member? I explained this to you? GUNTHER!!!
X: Wenk.
X: Well, anyway, as you can see, I'm not wearing my—
X: Wenk.
X: I'm not wearing my—
X: Wenk wenk.
X: Sweetie, I raised my voice because you were giving me the silent treatment. You understand?
X: Wenk.
X: I love you.
X: Can we fast-forward?
X: No, man, we might miss something.
Ice King There must be more to life than this...
X: Wenk.
X: I know. You don't like when I'm contemplative. ...C-contemplative... No, con-temp-la—Let's put on a play!
X: What?!?
Ice King Oh, Ice King! You're so cool! You take such good care of yourself! I wanna be with you!
X: Wenk. Wenk wenk.
X: No, Gunther, beard stays on.
X: Wenk.
X: Gunther, I need ya to wear the beard!
X: Wenk!
X: Gunther!
X: Hey, pause it, BMO.
X: There's gotta be some evil secrets in here. I wanna keep watching.
X: Okay... Well, why don't I make us some snacks? So I don't have to watch... this...
BMO: Can we sit on the floor? I feel so far away from you guys!
X: Wenk.
X: Wenk!
Ice King
X: Thanks, Gunther.
X: Oh, fine! Who needs you? More dance party for us, right, Gunther?
X: There's probably some evil secrets coming up. Someone wants to see the secret tapes!
X: What? Oh, but I was so clear in my flier!
BMO: Let's peek through the window and check who it is! Maybe it's just pizza.
X: Right!
X: Wait! Wait!
X: What?
X: You guys are checking too loud!
X: More quietly!
BMO: I am quieter now.
X: Cool.
X: Hey, guys, it's me. Can I come in and watch the secret tapes with you? I brought some gifts!
X: Aah!
X: Okay. If we're quiet long enough, Ice King will think no one's home and go away.
X: Eh... No one's home. Guess I'll go away.
X: Huh?
X: Just turn your alarm off!
X: Hmm. That sounds like BMO!
BMO: My alarm says it's time for Finn's bath. Finn, get naked.
X: No, just hit your snooze button!
BMO: I cannot self-snooze. It's against my programming.
X: Well, then, tell me how to do it!
BMO: Press and hold. I'm sorry. ...We can still take a bath...
X: He must know we're watching his tapes. We need to find his secrets faster.
X: Oh, diary! Thank you for listening to me!
X: Fast-forward, BMO.
X: Play, BMO.
Ice King You know, dear diary, I'm starting to worry that all these entries sound exactly the same, and that my life is just me running in place on some... giant hamster wheel.
X: Fast-forward, BMO.
X: I'm gonna take a nap...
X: No! These tapes are important! We just don't know why yet. BMO, fast-forward to triple speed!
BMO: Okay.
X: BMO, play normal speed.
Ice King I can't do it...
X: Maybe he's talkin' in secret code.
X: Telling evil secrets in secret code... He's brilliant!
X: Well, how do we decode the secrets?
BMO: Why don't we call others for help?
X: BMO, you're brilliant!
X: Well, who do we call?
X: Um... The smartest person we know, Princess Bubblegum! She's brilliant...
X: Hey, Princess Bubblegum.
X: Hey, Finn.
X: Jake and I found a bunch of secret tapes! We were wondering if you'd help us decode them.
X: Codes?
X: Yeah, they're really stupid, but, y'know... Maybe they're encoded or whateva.
X: Oh, you called the right person. I know a lot about codes. Let's start with—
X: What?
X: Ohh...
X: Hey, Princess. We got disconnected.
X: Hey/Uhhh, you sound weird!
X: Must be a bad connection. That's why we were disconnected earlier on the telephone.
BMO: Ice King is on the phone outside!
X: So... how's the weather in Candy Kingdom?
X: Oh, the usual. There's ice everywhere and it smells like penguins!
X: The only thing that smells like penguins is you, Ice King!!
X: How did you—
X: What're you doing?!
X: I wanna watch secret tapes with you guys. It'll be nice.
X: No, man!
X: But—
X: He doesn't know that we're watching his tapes. We gotta find these evil secrets before he uses them against us!
X: Oh... Fine. No more nice. NOW YOU GET ICE!! Try watching those tapes with FROZEN EYEBALLS!


=== S3E20 ===
X: ...AAAAAAAAAaaa je te plumerai!
X: Huh. I guess you do know all the words. Anyway, start the next video, BMO. We gotta crack the code on the Ice King's evil secret tapes!
X: Brrrr... You guys cold?
X: Yeah, it's kinda chilly in here.
X: Wenk.
X: Could I have five more minutes, please?
BMO: I think I can break the code, Finn.
X: Really?
BMO: Yes. I have detected a noticeable pattern in the tears of sadness that fall from the Ice King's eyeballs. His tears drop at an equal rate until the thirteenth tear, when the right eye drops two tears instead of one.
X: Whoa...
X: This is so fascinating...
BMO: The thirteenth letter of the alphabet is "M." If I print the letter "M" every time the Ice King says an "M" word, it looks like this!
X: Oh, my Glob, Jake... Is this it? Could this be the Ice King's evil secret? WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!
X: Some of you won't survive this. You'll melt or split in half or your head will fall off... but that's fine... because you're made of snow. Only one thing matters today! Getting into that tree house, getting my tapes back, and beating up Finn and Jake! Oh, that's right. You're not alive yet. My bad.
X: Gimme my tapes back.
X: No, man! I know you've got evil secrets on these, and we're gonna find 'em!
X: Snowmen! Attack!
X: Crip, Jake! We gotta unravel these evil secrets at warp-crazy!
Ice King Princess, what is your name?
X: Please! Let me go home!
X: So, Princess "Please-let-me-go-home," what was it like to experience this tragedy?
X: What? I... I don't... uh... um...
X: Yeah, we're on air, honey, so spit it out.
X: I... I don't know what you're talking about.
X: Obviously traumatized and in a state of shock. Let's go ask somebody else something. Upside-down Princess, do you think things will change politically because of today's events?
X: You're really frightening me.
X: Well, there ya have it, folks. People are very upset that Gunther tried to eat Ice King's socks! Very upset! That's why Gunther has to stay in the corner!
X: Weird... He's sneakin' in through the chimney!
X: Ah... The element of surprise... Ah, jeez, I'm filthy. Come on, come on!
X: Yeeeesh.....
X: Now gimme my evil tapes back!! They're supposed to be buried!! In the ground!! Snow goons!!
BMO: Oh, no!
X: Don't worry, BMO!
BMO: Finn! There is one more tape!
X: Play it! His evil secret must be on that tape!!
X: No, BMO, please don't play it.
X: Hello. My name is Simon Petrikov. I am recording this tape so that people will know my story.
X: Oh, no! Turn it off, BMO, turn it off!!
X: I was studying to be an antiquarian of ancient artifacts. Now, I never believed in the supernatural stuff myself—just had a fascination with superstitions... but everything changed when I came into contact with this item....
X: The Ice King!!
X: After purchasing this crown from an old dock worker in northern Scandinavia, I brought it home and excitedly showed my fiancée Betty, looking at me with such contempt. What had I said? What had I done when I wore this crown? All I know is I never saw Betty again.
X: Since then, I see the visions always whether or not I wear the crown. They tell me the secrets... the secrets of the ice and snow... that the power of the crown will save me with its frost. I don't yet know what this means. As you can see, my skin is beginning to turn blue. My body temperature has been lowering at a supernatural rate, to what is now about 30°C. I don't know when it will end... I'm really scared...
X: I know my mind is changing... but I'm already too far gone to know what to do. I want people to know that... if I do things... if I do things that hurt anyone, please... please forgive me.
X: Just watch over me until I can find a way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity!! And then maybe Betty, my princess... maybe you will love me again. Please love me again, Betty!!
X: Drrr-AMA bomb!!
X: Now you know my secret! You know... that I used to wear glasses! Maybe kidnapping Wildberry Princess will cheer me up.
X: Wait, Ice King. Here, Ice King.
X: What's this? You're giving me... a gift.
X: No... It's... well... These belong to you.
X: But it's not even my birthday! This is so exciting! Video tapes! Heh, you know, I had a bunch of these once, but I threw them away! This is great, Finn! Thank you!
X: It's from me, too.
X: Oh! I have presents for you guys, too! is for you!
X: Uh... thanks.
X: Oh, isn't this fun?! We're giving each other presents, we're wearing silly clothes, there's snow everywhere... Let's do this every day!
X: Uh...
X: How about once a year?
X: Okay, that sounds good.
X: And so it was decided... that once every year when the weather got chilly, that Finn, Jake, the Ice King, BMO, Princess Bubblegum, Marceline the Vampire Queen, Cinnamon Bun, Peppermint Butler, Phil, a candy cane man, one of the gumdrop girls, Lady Rainicorn, Lumpy Space Princess, that guy, the other guy, a pig, Tree Trunks, a two-headed duck, the old crazy Tart Toter, the punch bowl, a booger, and Gunter... would get together while wearing really big sweaters and watch videos on the floor next to a fire... to celebrate the day when Finn and Jake had a fleeting moment of empathy for the biggest weirdo in Ooo. It was a miracle. Good night.


=== S3E25 ===
X: Alright. Whaddaya wanna see next?
X: A cheetah! A fart!
BMO: A cookie! An external hard drive! Ooh, ooh! Change into Finn, but give him my body!
X: BMO, your ideas are boring.
BMO: What? Your head on my body isn't boring! It's weird!
X: Alright, I'll try to turn into a cheetah farting. I can't do the spots.
X: Sparkles on the house? LET'S SQUISH 'EM!
X: Did you squish the sparkles?
X: No. They're around this holo-message player. It's got a cartridge with it.
X: Oh, snap! Well, plop that cartridge in the slot, playah!
X: Yeah! Okay!
Joshua
X: Dad!!
Joshua I made you boys something. It's a dungeon. A proper dungeon. Full of evil monsters, traps, and magic. The whole kazoo!
X: Whoa! Kickin'! Kickin'!
Joshua Jake... really, this dungeon is for Finn. I know I won't be around forever, and I wanna make something that will force Finn to toughen up.
X: What?!
X: Now, tell Finn to uncover his ears now.
X: Dude, take your hands off your head.
X: WHAT?!?!
X: Alright, boys. Now to give you some incentive, at the end of the dungeon, I'm going to put the Family Sword. It's made out of Demon's Blood.
X: Whoa, what the--?!
X: Whoa, dang!
X: Give me back my blood, Joshua!
X: Kee Oth Rama Pancake.
Blood Demon
X: Whoa!!
X: Geez-louise!
X: The dungeon's eighty paces west of here under a dumb-lookin' rock. And Finn, this dungeon's gonna kick your tail. I bet you won't even get past the first trial, ya whiny baby!
X: What?? What was that about?
X: Uh...
X: Duh... duh... du-ugh... duh...
X: Whoo!
X: Whoa! Burgers and hotdogs! Yeah, yeah, YEAH!
X: Wait, Jake!
X: But... burgers and hotdogs..
X: Didn't you say you were hungry for burgers this morning?
X: Yeah, so?
X: And I said I was hungry for hotdogs?
X: Mm-hmm, I remember.
X: I don't think those burgers and hotdogs are burgers and hotdogs at all.
X: Aaaahh...
X: Look!
X: Finn, cover up those nubs on your head.
X: Man... again?
Joshua In order for Finn to stop whining, he needs to be put through a trial that forces him to take charge of a situation.
X: But Dad, Finn's already figured that out. He's a good kid with a kind heart.
X: Remember, Jake, this is a prerecorded holo-message. I can't hear you if you're talking to me right now.
X: I'm gonna go walk around!
X: Okay!
X: Jake, I need your help. You gotta call Finn a whiny baby.
X: But—
X: Butts are for pooping! Do it for Poppy!
X: Finn!
X: Over here! Check it out, Jake. I found two ways. This way has some kinda flower trap, and that way... has that guy.
X: None shall pass!
X: Ugh... Let's take the flower path!
X: Mmm.
X: Wait! Why don't you wanna take my path?!
X: Because... you're super gross, man.
X: Oh...
X: Cheer up, man. We're only tellin' you you're gross because we're your bros.
X: Really?
X: Yeah! Bros are real with each other, and you're gross, brother. Take a bath.
X: Thanks, brother. Hahaha.
X: Hahaha, no probs. Hey, what did Dad say?
X: Um... He said he's surprised a whiny baby like you made it this far.
X: What?! Why's Dad sayin' all that jive??
X: Mm...
X: Jake, do it for Poppy!
X: Because... you cry like a baby... Baby!
X: Dude... you're pickin' on me, too?
X: Whoa.
X: I don't even cry much. I only cry when it's healthy, like when people die.
X: Partake of the fruit...
X: Pff, blech... If I didn't cry when people died, I'd have a cold butt for a heart.
X: The fruuuuit...
X: Waaaah, I cry when people die. Waaah, I'm Finn.
X: Partake of the fruit!
X: Maybe I will partake of the fruit.
X: Dude, don't eat that!!
X: Why not? All the people that I care about in this world are being wads.
X: Don't you blow Poppy's cover!
X: Whoa.
X: Time to go, baby. Finn, come on!
X: I'm gonna hang here. With these fruit babes. They'll be my best buds now.
X: Rrrr... Yah!
X: There's another cartridge. Alright, man, Dad told me not to tell you this, but—
X: Don't tell 'im!
X: You're not real. Dad asked me to call you "Baby" because he wants you to be tough.
X: But I'm tough! My whole body is a callus!
X: Hmmph.
Joshua WAAAAAH!!
X: DAD!
X: Dad's sword!
X: Hey, Jake, when Finn finishes this dungeon, play this tape for him...
X: Finn! Dude! Use your karate biz!
X: Ugh... I— I can't, man. I suck. I'm a whiny baby, and I'm fat, and all those things Dad said about me!
X: Dude... Dad loves you!
X: Finn! If you're seeing this prerecorded holo-message, it's because you finished the dungeon that I made for you. I'm proud of you. You're gonna do great things in this world. I love you, son.
X: Duh... Duh...
X: I made you boys something. It's babies. Full of babies. ...the family sword. It's made out of—babies.
X: You know I don't think you're a baby, right?
X: Yeah. I know.
X: That sword is sweet!
X: Yeah! I'm stoked to slay some evil with it.
X: Joshua! Return my blood to me, or by demon's law, I will cut off your love handles!!! Joshua, we go way back. Come on! Just give me back my blood!
X: Kee Oth Rama Pancake.
X: NOOOOOOO!!!
X: Man... Dad was cool.
X: Yeah.


=== S3E26 ===
X: And so, through my experiments with cloud-seeding, I've invented... liquid pyrotechnics.
X: That's really cool, PB!
X: Aw, thanks, puppy.
X: Isn't it cool, Finn?
X: Owwww-guh...
X: Uh, Finn. No. Come on, Finn, don't be weird. Look, I'll see you guys later.
X: Huh? Oh.
X: It's letting up. Hey, Finn, come on, let's go do something.
X:  BMO, put on a game.
X: Oh, Finn.... Uncle Jakey's gonna find you a new love interest.
X: Finn, I'm going out for a quick.... walk in the woods.
X: BMO, you look after him with your camera-eyes.
BMO: If anyone tries to hurt Finn, I will kill them.
X: Ok, good.
X: Woman!
X: I'll save you, wash tub princess!
X: You're safe now, Miss... Flambo?!
X: Yeah, it's me. Bet you thought I was dame on account of my girlish screamin'.
X: I did think that.
X: Haha, well. Thanks, anyway, brother.
X: Hey.... You're pretty plugged-in, Flambo. Do you know any princesses Finn's age?
X: Oh, yeah. I know just the skirt, ...and she's way hot!
X: She's from Fire Kingdom? I think I'll die if I go in there.
X: Heh, oh yeah.
X: Ow...
X: There, I cast Flame Shield on yous. Also I spat on yous.
X: BMO-cam on.
Finn
X: Ugh... Hang in there, buddy.
X: Dooug.
X: Dude, you gotta pretend like you're of royal blood.
X: Could have told me this sooner.
X: Haha! Yeah.
X: Good morrow, Majesty! I am Sir Jake, Baron of the Grasslands!
X: Hmmmmm.... What do you seek? Speak!
X: Uhk-uhg... I come as an envoy of Prince Finn.
X: A prince?!
X: A prince! Finn is a prince! Yeah, a prince!
X: Yeah and he's the same age as your daughter.
X: Oooh...
X: Bold words, but know you that my daughter is a rare jewel. She cannot be wooed by just any ragamuffin prince!
X: Umm.... Oh, Prince Finn is AWESOME!
X: An awesome prince?! That's the best kind!
X: Silence, my molten mommas. We are perplexed. If you are a baron true, where is your gift? 'Tis common practice among visiting dignitaries.
X: Yeah, a gift! Where is the gift?!
X: You're blowin' it, bromite.
X: What?!
X: Hmmmm.... Three is more than one.
X: Wait a second, three's a lot of gifts! I want three gifts!
X: Oooh...
X: The first gift is um-um-um this water bottle.
Whoap!
X: Prince Finn has smoked my jester! Pourquoi?! ("Why?!") ...I do hate my jester.
X: Uh, Prince Finn hated him too.
X: Hmmm...
X: For your second gift, a, uh... hmmmm oh!
that Finn wrote for m'lady.
X: A fire inside my body?! I am disgusted! Give me your third terrible gift and be on your way!
X: Oh, Finn, I'm so sorry!
BMO: Whoooop.... Duck, Duck, Duck, Goose!
Finn
X: Is that him? He looks terrible! Why isn't he here? Why did he send his buffoon?! Leave now, buffoon, for you have failed!
X: No, wait! Uh-um, He's riiight... here!
X: Greetings, Flame King! My final gift is your favorite thing in the world.
X: A koala bear?
X: Uh, yes!
X: Eucalyptus! Eucalyptus!
X: I don't like koalas anymore. Begone!
Jake
X: Dude, don't cry.
X: Can't help it! I'm in love with Bubblegum!
X: She's too old for you.
Jake I don't care!
X: Come on! Flame Princess seems into you.
X: No, no, no! Only Bubblegum!
X: Ouw, Finn! Finn, Finn, Finn, Finn stop man....
X: Ahh-ahh!
X: Excellent!
X: Huh?!
X: You have indeed proven yourself! Any prince ruthless enough to kill his own buffoon would make an excellent boyfriend...
X: Yeah!
X: ... for my evil daughter!
X: Whaaaat?!
X: She's an unstoppable force of destruction. Ahhhh, nothing a psycho like you can't handle. Congratulations!
X: I'm so happy! I'm so happy to meet you, Prince. You're my Prince.
X: That's sweet. That's so sweet.
X: She seems normal.
X: Yeah, she seems normal.
X: Stop whispering!
X: Hey, so that's where I came from.
X: You know, on second thought, ...we're not really each other's types.
X: We're... what?
X: I changed my mind. I don't like you.
X: You... WHAT?!
Jake
X: Finn! I really messed up.
X: Finn, buddy, you gotta help me. I made a mistake.
X: Who lit that fire?! I'll kill you!
X: Don't you touch her stuff!!!
X: It's a girl.
X: You! What's wrong with me, huh?! You don't like me?!
X: I like you!
X: What's wrong with you?!
X: Don't ever mess with me again!
X: Who was that?
X: The Princess of the Fire Kingdom?
X: Dude, I think I have a crush.

Five stories each relating to one special theme. See if you graybles can guess the theme by the end of the episode, okay? Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.
X: Okay, BMO, be back in an hour. You sure you don't need anything from the Grocery Kingdom?

X: Ha ha! Jingo-jango!
X: Yeast on third, flour on first, swell the dough, fit to burst! Awhoooooo!
X: Well... this is it, Cinnamon Bun. The most perfect sandwich that has ever existed, or ever will exist within the confines of space-time. Will you do the honors?
X: Okay.
X: But... but you... you didn't... y-y-you didn't even... taste it...
X: Thanks, Princess. Peace out.
X: Blegh, Gunter, something stinks! Oh, don't be sad, stinky. Come with daddy and I'll make it aaaall better.
X: Goodbye, Gunter. Sorry, sweetie, but I'm never gonna get any princesses if you're stinkin' up the place! Oh, it's me. I smell horrible.
X: Scrub, penguins! Scrub harder! We are not stopping until the stench is completely gone!
X: Gunter! Guess what? It was me who was smelly, not you!
X: Wenk.
X: Sorry. I thought you had a stank booty, Gunter. My bad. Although I have no idea how my armpits got so stinky.
X: Everyone's worthless at this talent show. I'm totally gonna win when I sing, "These lumps! I know you wanna slump up on these lumps! But you can't 'cause you're a chump! A chuuump!"
X: You're totally gonna win, LSP.

X: That was the most amazing thing ever! LSP wins!!
X: Really?! Oh, my gosh, you guys!! I just wanna thank y'all so much! It means so much to me! And I just wanted to say I... I...
X: Finn and Jake win the talent show!
X: WHAT?!?!
X: Awesome...
X: That... was... awesome...
X: The theme was the five senses! You see? Look. BMO saw his reflection. Finn and Jake touched their hands together! The Princess made a tasty sandwich! The blue guy smelled bad! And the other thing heard music. Oh, what a treat! Okay, well I'll see you trimpy flimmers on triode flimpin' the diode!


=== S4E6 ===
X: Yo BMO, you done chargin' up that phone or what?
BMO: Almost... finished...
X: Yo yo yo yo, check it! This is Jake on my camera phone! Whooooooooooaaaaaaa. Whoooa! Yo, Finn! Say 'hi' to my new camera phone!
X: Whaddup camera phone!
X: Marceline!
X: You guys wanna come party in the Nightosphere with me? I'm visiting with my dad and it's craaaazy boring.
X: Whoa, wait a minute Marceline. Last time I saw your dad,
X: Oh no, he's totally chill now.
X: Okay, but I'm keepin' an eye out for your old man in case he pulls any sneak attacks.
X: Don't be a wiener dog. Jake, you coming?
X: Whoo! Yeah, baby!
X: Alright. So, this is the Nightosphere, I guess. Hehehe.
X: There you are, Marceline.
X: Stay away from me, old man!
X: Heheheh, nice one.
X: See how I'm not killing you?
X: Dad, stop!
X: So young lady, have you thought about my offer?
X: What offer, Marceline's dad?
X: I want Marceline to take over the Nightosphere! Finally join the family business!
X: Business? Dad, what do you even do?
X: Oh! How everyone's confused and frustrated? The Nightosphere is sustained by chaos!
X: Eh, I just don't see my self doing this biz'.
X: Dad!
X: Whoops! Hahaha! You should put this amulet on. It'll grant you wishes for, like, ponies. Or whatever kids like.
X: Dad, I'm a thousand years old.
X: Ha! Yes you are, sweetie.
X: Look, let's play something, okay?
X: Okay!
X: Psssh. Whatever, Dad. [Puts the amulet on. A suit comes out of it and wraps itself around her. The phone is dropped and tentacles are seen. The phone is picked up and Marceline is seen looking like her father's monster's form in "It Came from the Nightosphere." The camera zooms out to show Finn approaching Marceline while she laughs evilly.
X: Jake, grab the amulet!
X: Ow, my hippocampus!
X: Well... that explains how we got amnesia-ed. But what about banana?
X: Hey man, there's another video!
X: We got mad prison overcrowding down here, fellas.
X: That amulet's controlling Marceline! We have to go back and help her!
X: She told us never to come back!
X: Oh yeah. Oh! Jake! Can you turn into a gross demon?
X: Mhmm.
X: Grosser!
X: What's your disguise?
X: Paper plate mask, yo!
X: Nice!
X: Let's go!
X: Who's next? Who's next?
X: Uh... me, my lord "Aberdeer."
X: What do you desire, cowering spec? Pain? Pleasure? Or... weird punishment?
X: Uh... pleasure.
X: No, weird punishment! And what do you desire? P, P, or WP?
X: I... pain?
X: Okay.
X: Aw.
X: Come on, come on, next!
X: Uh... I'm just gonna go.
X: You sure, dude? Don't you want abs?
X: Yeah, gimme abs!
X: I think we can charge up there and rip the amulet off her neck.
X: Hey! What're you guys doin'?! You can't run up to the front of the line! These good people have been waiting forever! Shame on you both! Everybody, shame them! Under... stand?!
X: Yeah, okay, okay!
X: I'll be watching you!
X: Sorry dude, you got outta line. I-
X: Dang it!
X: Who are you?
X: Ahh! Don't kill us Marceline!
X: It's us! Finn and Jake!
X: Your friends, remember?
X: Eh.
X: Oh Grod!
X: Run! Marceline...
X: What are you doing?
X: Just grabbing a midnight snack.
X: It's Marceline! That's her out there!
X: I know! Isn't it fantastic?
X: No! We have to save 'er!
X: Save her?
X: From the amulet!
X: But this is what I've always wanted! My girl, following in her daddy's footsteps.
X: But that's not what she wants!
X: That's balderdash, baby. The wearer of the amulet is filled with chaotic evil! Which is how I grew up. So...
X: Maybe we can get these dudes to help us!
X: These guys won't help you. They're all complacent sheeple.
X: Wait, that's it! We're gonna freestyle a political rap to get these guys to rise out of their systemized demon apathy.
X: I never thought of it that way before!
X: The system is broke, yo!
X: Marceline!
X: Aw, sick!
X: Jake! The tree house!
X: Ahhhh! I'm too freaked out to move, Finn! These demons are nibbling my legs!
X: No, Finn! You'll be filled with chaotic evil!
X: Marceline... leaves the Nightosphere!
X: Marceline! Um, I wonder what happened to him! Kids these days... am I right?
X: Dude... seriously.
X: Dad, you tricked me. Dad, that sucks!
X: I know, I'm sorry. But I thought you'd want to, want to make your old man proud and you know... take over the Nightosphere.
X: Yeah, I want you to be proud. I want you to be proud of me!
X: No, I didn't mean... Baby, of course I'm proud of you.
X: Dad...
X: And your friends? They're alright! That political rap? Pretty great!
X: Okay, okay, I gotta go now, Dad. Finn?


=== S4E7 ===
X: You gonna do the thing again?!
X: Yeah, man!
X: Whaaaat?
X: Nice.
X: Hey, Princess Bubblegum. Hey, everybody.
X: Dancin' is rough!
X: Yeah... I'm havin' some sweat issues here! I'll go get us some snackety-juice.
X: Hey, man. I'm Jake. Hmmmm...
X: Check it out, Jake! I got us some peanuts. And punch!
X: Choking!! Don't give up on me, man!
X: Whoa, Finn, nice book.
X: Haha. He's all good! Everybody get back to your dancin'!
X: Uh, Finn? I think that bear is followin' us home.
X: Whoa. Haha. I think you're right. Hey, bear, you gonna come hang out with us? Heh-heh. Awesome.
X: I dunno, Finn. This guy seems kinda weird.
X: Yeah. He's totally weird. Hahaha!
X: Mmmmm...
X: Jake! Hey, Jake! Jake!
X: Jake
X: Come here! Ya gotta check this out!
X: Eh, okay.
X: Check this out, man. This bear is tops blooby! Ya gotta try this, Jake. He does everything I do!
X: Haha, come on, Jake, try it!
BMO: It's awesome!
X: Heh-heh. Um... Yeah, okay. Sweepy-sweepy-sweepy. Sweep sweep sweep. Sweepin'!
X: He's got me down pat! Heh-hah! Sweeping's weak.
X: Mmmmmm...
X: Sweeping weak.
X: Whoa! This guy's alright!
X: This guy just busted me up my chops, Finn!
X: Hey, come on, he's just a bear. He don't know nothin'.
X: Mmmm... Yeah, I guess. Well, anyway, it's gettin' pretty late. Probably time for everyone to go back home to their own houses.
X: Yeah, I guess you're right, Jake. It is pretty late. He should probably stay here tonight. You can sleep in the bathtub!
X: Braaaathtrub. Sleep in.
X: Brathtrub, hahaha! This guy's tops blooby!
X: Whaaaat? Hey!
X: What are you doing?!
X: Shhh. Come with me. Ya gotta see somethin'. This bear's wiggy, Finn. It's wearing your clothes and dancin' around all crazy.
X: That sounds rad, man.
X: What?! No—Just—! ... Rrrr!
X: Aw, man!
X: ...I do believe you.
X: Oh.
X: It's just, y'know, who cares? Dancing, wearing clothes... He ain't hurtin' nobody. He's just doin' it up, y'know? He's just cool, and he likes my style. That ain't a crime.
X: No. I guess not.
X: Okay. Great. I'm going back to bed. You comin', smart guy?
X: Yeah, okay.
X: You're not even a little weirded out by this?
X: No, man. He's just doin' his instincts. He's like a parrot or chameleon or something. He's funny!
X: don't eat my special Finn Cakes. Finn only.
X: Yeah, I get it. You don't need to tell me that every time you make Finn Cakes.
X: Hey, what are you doin'?!
X: OH, MY GLOB, WHAT?!?! JAKE! YOU ATE ALL MY FINN CAKES! WHAT THE STINK!
X: Uh, nope. The bear did it, and I've got proof. I taped the whole thing.
X: The bear ate all my cakes, and you just sat there and watched him do it?! What's wrong with you?!
X: Ju— What?! No, man, he was tryin' to frame me, Finn! He's tryin' to steal your identity! Why can't you grok that?!
X: He's a bear, Jake! He's a wild animal! He doesn't know things! He just does stuff! He's cool!
X: Ohh, fine, then that's just great. Then you and M.C. Cool Friend can go stink it up together at your stupid cool Finn party all by yourself, cause I'm not going!
X: ...Wait. What? What party?
X: What? Your party, man. Tonight? In the woods?
X: "Finn'z... bezt... party?" But... I didn't make this flyer.
X: Huh?! Well, who did, then?!
X: The bear.
X: ...I knew it.
X: See, dude? He's not just jackin' your style. He's jackin' your whole you! Jackin' yo you up!
X: What the what?
X: He got in close and used you. Now he's feedin' nuts to your ex-girlfriend!
X: ...peanut.
X: She's not my... We never went steady.
X: He's trying to replace you, and he's already got everyone convinced he's you! He didn't really like you. He used you.
X: Troops brooby! Troops brooby. Troops—
X: Not cool, man. It's okay, everyone. The imposter is gone.
X: Finn... nobody really thought the bear was you.
X: Wait... what?
X: We just thought it was one of your jokey-joke-jokes.
X: Hey! Hey, bear!
X: Wait up, guy!
X: Hey. I... I didn't mean to make you feel so bad about yourself. I'm really sorry about that.
X: Me, too.
X: But... you're a super-rad bear, so... why not just be you?
X: I... want... be... hero... like... yooouuuu!
X: Awww...
X: I guess he's got a heart of gold after all.
X: Hold on, bear. I got something for ya. It's the Enchiridion, the hero's handbook. Everything you need to know about being a hero is in this book. Take it, and learn.
X: Finn, are you nuts?! We can't give that book away! It's, like, crazy-important!
X: Whatever, man. We never use it, except for, like, sitting on it when the grass is wet and stuff. Drink your fill of knowledge. Someday, you'll be a great hero.
X: Thank you, Finn. Thank... yooouuu...
X: Did you bring the book?
X: Yessss... One step closer.


=== S4E8 ===
X: The Tree of Blight.
X: Every hundred years, it spews evil spores across the land.
X: Then let's burn its butt down to the root rubbin's. Finn, I can feel a bunch of eyeballs peepin' us from the woods.
X: Huuugs!
X: What the—?! Is this an extra butt?! Quick, Jake! Burn the tree!
X: Huuuugs! Gonna hug you up, boy! I'm gonna snuggle you to pieces!
X: Dude! The tree's about to 'splode its evil juice all over!
X: No! Jake, hurry!
X: Is he crushin' you, man?!
X: No, he's just... hugging me gently!
X: Oh...! When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife, tell 'im Jake says, "Hello."
X: Hey, buddy, you okay?
X: Didn't even tell me its name...
X: Wha..,?
X: Oh, sweet! Ha-ha-ha!
X: Hot to the touch!
X: Hmmmm... Dude, why're you so huggy?
X: I just feel affectionate, I guess. Hugging helps.
X: Hmm... You've got a fever, man.
X: I feel hot.
BMO: Finn, you're hurting me.
X: I think you need a good night's sleep.
X: You feelin' better today?
X: Yeah. I feel like a million clams.
X: Good. Hey, you think we have enough candy litter? Litter for lunch! Mmm!
X: Huh? Not again!
X: What's the matter, Cinnamon Bun?
X: Please, Finn. If you're gonna hug me again, don't make it as hard as you hugged me last night.
X: Uh... I didn't hug you last night.
X: Yes, you did! My love handles still hurt! You came into my room around midnight and gave me a squeeze—a really strong one!
X: CB says I hugged 'im. Haha. Cinnamon Bun, you got some crazy notions. I tell ya. What a crazy story, buddy.
X: Yeah, buddy, but you were pretty huggy last night... buddy.
X: Wait. You don't think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Bun's room and hugged him, do you?
X: I'm just sayin' you were really clingy.
X: But no. Why would I? And don't tell me it's because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun.
X: No. I have a theory, ...but I don't like it.
X: Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf man, right?
X: ...So...?
X: Well, I've been thinkin' that maybe that wolf man wasn't what he seemed. Maybe he was some sort of hug wolf. Yeah, here it is. "Hug wolves—a subset of wolf men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug lust. Every night, hug wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs. To become a hug wolf, one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon."!
X: Like last night!
X: Yes. So you must be a beta hug wolf. A lower-level creature.
X: Well, how can I get uncursed?
X: Lemme, um... read the book a little more. Says there's no known cure.
X: Uh... I'm scared, Jake...
X: No hugs!!
X: I'm sorry! I feel hot! Rrrrr!!
X: What's wrong, BMO?
BMO: I am terrified of Finn.
X: Hmm. Well, that plant's not gonna protect you. You can get this under control, buddy. ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??
X: I think so.
X: I said... ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??
X: Yeah. I heard you. I said I think so.
X: I'm tryin'a' getcha to shout.
X: Oh. Okay. IS THIS GOOD?!?
X: Never mind. Now. I want you to think about hugging a cactus. How would that feel?
X: Prickly and painful.
X: Good, good, you're doin' great!
X: Cool. So, can I hug the cactus now?
X: No, you can't hug anything.
X: But that poor cactus! It... it... NEEDS ME!
X: Oh, no, the hug lust is already takin' over your brain!
X: I want to hug you, Jake! Close!
X: Finn... say something to reassure me.
X: I'LL HUG YOUR MOM!
BMO: Jake! We need the silver baseball!
X: Hrrugs!! HUGS FOR BUDDIES!
BMO: Oh, Glob! Oh, my Glob, Jake! Mama!
X: Bring it in, guys!
BMO: Screamoooo!
X: BMO! Strobe light mode!
X: Not cool!
X: Back, beast!
X: Hug wolf, away!
X: Surely this frosted drink will soothe my fevered tempers. Hellooo? Good heavens! A lycanthrope! AAAAH!!
X: Dracula? AAAAH!! Eeee!!
X: HUUUUGS!!
X: Get away from my daughter, ya hairy teenager!
X: Aaah!!
X: Ch-ch.
X: Finn? Finn?
BMO: There he is!
X: Huh? Huh? What... What happened? Jake... what happened to me last night?
X: You hugged... everyone.
X: NO!
X: We're mad, but we're not gonna go down there.
X: People of the Candy Kingdom, all I've ever wanted was to keep you all safe, ...and because I can't undo the hugs I've caused, my sole wish is to be locked up forever in the Candy Dungeon.
X: Why's Finn in the cage, Mama? Isn't hugs nice?
X: Oh, baby...
X: Candy People, let's make sure that Alpha Hug Wolf pays for what he's done!!
X: Yeah!
X: Yeah, I agree with the last guy!
X: Cinnamon Bun, you watch over Finn!
X: Uuuuuhhhh...
X: Let's go, boys!!
X: Uh... bu-, bububut...
X: No more hugs! No more hugs! No more hugs!
X: Without consent!!
X: Uh...
X: Huh?
X: Finn? Uh...
X: Cinnamon Bun... let me out...
X: I-I-I-I'm not supposed to.
X: Don't you want a hug?
X: I can't, man!
X: Not even a little one?
X: Uuuuhhh...
X: You want a hug?
X: Owww! Ow, my sides.
X: SAY NO TO HUGS!
X: I smell someone bein' hugged right now!
X: Uh... I have a wife.
X: That hug be your last, demon!
X: Rrr...still love you! Raaah! Come here, baby!
X: No huggies! Eh... Finn... I've failed you.
X: I'm gonna hug you up.
X: You call that a hug?
X: This is the biggest hug that's ever existed!
Finn You... You stopped hugging me.
X: Yeah... You stopped, too.
X: I just... didn't feel like I needed any more hugs.
X: Me neither.
X: The curse is broken!
X: Can I get a hug?
X: JAKE!!!!!
X: AAAH—!


=== S4E11 ===
X: Man... let's go home.
X: Nuts to that. I wanna find a mystery cave.
X: But, Finn, I'm gettin' all cranky around my joke-hole.
X: Ow!
X: Oof!
X: Ooh-la-la.
X: Whuzzat?
X: Mystery cave! C'mon, Jake! Oh, my glory...
X: Dude, no!! Don't touch that thing! It's probably got some kind of sacred significance.
X: Yeah. I want it for my sacred bathroom.
X: Finn?! Oh, my Jah! Finn's become one with the lamb!!
X: Jake!! You see this crazy jazz?!
X: We'll get through this, my bro. I swear, I'm gonna get you out of that lamb.
[Jake goes down the pyramid steps and sits down. He tugs his tail twice and starts pulling himself out by retracting his tail.
X: Jake! C'mon quit messin' with me. WHOA!
X: Wish I knew how to free you, bro.
X: Me, too, bro.
X: BMO, stop fake-farting.
BMO: But Finn always loved BMO farting.
X: Heh heh heh heh heh!
X: Hmm... That's it! We'll do all Finn's favorite stuff 'til he comes out! BMO! Play Finn's favorite song!
BMO: Okay!
X: What? Nooo... No! Not this song!!
X: Are you hearing this, buddy?
X: Guys... I haven't liked this song since I was two.
X: Leaf Princess! Come to me, my arboreal beauty! Gotcha!
X: It's just a dumb old leaf, ya dumb old Ice King.
X: I know, but it's mine.
X: Wait! What?! Ice King! You can hear me?
X: Yes... Why? Are you makin' fun of me or something?
X: No, it's just no one else can see me or hear me talk.
X: Ohhhh, yeah.... You're trapped in the Spirit Realm. I can see all things Spirit with my... Wizard Eyes!
X: Man... Never thought I'd be happy to talk to you, Ice King. Can ya help me get free??
X: Oh, yeah, I know all the ins and outs. And I'd do anything for a friend like you.
X: Wenk.
X: Quiet, Gunter. Can'tya see I'm hanging with Finn?
X: Wenk wenk.
X: I know I say that a lot, but this time it's true!
X: Anyways... Where do all these spirits come from?
X: Oh, there are portals all over the universe. I have one in my basement! Every once in a while, a real cutie pie drifts through. Ooh!
X: Sick.
X: What? I swear I never touch 'em! I can't! I hate them... Okay, alright! 'Nuff messin' around. Let's getcha free from the Spirit Plane.
X: Cool.
X: Sooo, the only way to get out of the Spirit World is to stick all these lousy things in the Spirit Hole down there. Then plug up the hole with that.
X: And doing that will set me back to normal??
X: Mm-hmmmm, trust me! We are tur-bros! Turbo bros! Tur-bros. Turbo. ...Bros.
X: So be it!
X: Alright, Finn. This oughta free you from your body prison. Couple-a' rounds of Kompy's Kastle will jog your psychic schnaps. That's what I think. Co-op mode like we always do! Oh, yeah! C'mon, Finn, drop the drawbridge. Kompy's blood lust meter's goin' down. Lemme help ya there.
X: I... did it. I did it. I'm ready, Ice King. Make me normal now.
X: Ohhh, that's not all of 'em. There's this other guy that watches me. He's... super creepy. GET IT IN THE HOLE!!
X: Yes! It's gone!
X: So... now I can go back to normal.
X: Uhhh, wait, though.
X: ...What?
X: There's this last guy you gotta get. He's pretty much the worst. He usually leaves these gross heads around, but I'm not seeing them anywhe— OH! THERE IT IS! THERE IT IS!!
X: Wanwan. Wanwan. Wanwan.
X: Nooo...
X: Wanwan! Wanwan!
X: NO! DON'T COME NEAR ME!!
X: Wanwan!
X: What is that?
X: It's from the dead one. He leaves these heads around everywhere. I can't even touch them, but it still creeps me out...
X: Wanwan!
X: Please get rid of him!
X: What do I do? Follow the heads?
X: USE THE HEADS!! Oh, snow, please!
X: Where's your daddy, huh? Is he hiding in there?
X: Wanwan.
X: You better get back in the Spirit Hole, dead one.
X: Wamwanwan.
X: Oh, my what? The cave?? How the...??? ...Weird. That's weird, but whatevs, though. Dude, come on, what?
X: Ha ha, Finn! You fell right into for my brilliant plan
X: I'm gonna re-open the hole.
X: NO, WAIT, MY PLAN FELL APART!! My... new plan is that you don't open the hole, and I destroy the porcelain lamb which will bring you back to the material plane. Heh heh... heh.
X: Jake. AGH, BLUH! GIMME THAT LAMB!
X: NO!! Finn's trapped in here!!
X: That's why I have to smash it!!
X: You donk! I will smash you!! WAAAH!!
X: Escaped!
X: Whoooo?!
X: AAH! They're touching me for real! EWW!!
X: Great. Now we're both stuck in here.
X: STOP! WUUH!
X: I need a buffer!! AAAH!
X: Ah, jeez, come on!
X: Whoa, do that again. Your hand is affecting the TV! We must have some kinda subtle effect on the material plane!
X: Cooool. Whaddaya think, Finn? Can we pull back the veil of static and reach into the source of all being? Behind this curtain of patterns... this random pattern generator... So clever... right here in every home, watching us from a one-sided mirror... Heh heh heh, whoops! Just wizard-talkin' to myself!
X: It's okay! But let's use our subtle influence to break the lamb!
X: Yeah, a'ight. You mean like this?
X: Yeah, man! Bwoooo! It's workin', man! Combine the swirls!
X: Okay! Wha-zah!!
X: Whoa! Finn, is that you?!
X: YES!!
X: Finn! Finn! Finn! That was beautiful!
X: Heh-heh.
X: Let's go flush this in the sacred bathroom!


=== S4E12 ===
BMO: Jake, if I beat you, you have to call me "sensei" for a month.
X: Deal.
X: Hi, guys!
X: 'Sup, Turtle Princess?
X: Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Get your hands off me, Steven!! YAH!
X: Heeeey, giiiirl!
X: Heeeey, giiiirl!
X: Brought you some little fruit pies.
X: Awesome.
X: How ya doin' out here?
X: Turtle Princess, the men out here will not leave me alone!
X: Huh... it must be nice.
X: Nah. It's horrible. They just want me for my lumps! Aren't you sick of men going after your turtle lumps?
X: Actually, I've never been able to work my T-lumps. I just know what I read in books. Hey! You should write a book telling me how to do it!
X: Oh, my Glob! Turtle Princess! I've always wanted to write trashy books for ladies! Yeah, everyone needs to know when I work these lumps, no man is immune to their influence!
X: Jake's ball landed over here, BMO!
X: LSP! Finn would be perfect as the test subject for your lump studies!
BMO: Yay! I win! Bow to your sensei!
X: Aaah...
X: Heh heh heh heh heh heh!
X: You gotta go undercover and conduct your lump science on him. Prove to the world that even a white knight like Finn is no match for the power of your lumps!
X: I'll do it! For the world! And for you, girl!
X: Oh, girl!
X: Hello?
X: Heeey, Jaaaake... Is Finn hooome...?
X: Ooh!
X: 'Sup, LSP?
X: Oh, hey. I'm answering that ad you put out for the adventure secretary.
X: Wha?
X: Ugh... Hold on. I'll get it. Hold on. It's down in there. Okay, wait, I got it. Uh, here you go.
X: Smells like fruit pie.
X: It's nice of you to wanna be our secretary... but we don't need one.
X: Dude, look at 'er.
X: Mmm... Oh, Glob...
X: Yeah, it's sad. Come on. We've gotta help 'er.
X: Alright, LSP. Come inside.
X: Awesome.
X: I'm gonna need a secretary desk! I'm starving! What's for dinner?!
X: Oh. Uh... We got some blueberries.
X: Jake has saltines.
X: Yuck. You got anything better to eat??
X: "Gotcha!"
X: Have a good night. See ya in the mornin'.
X: G'night, you guys!
X: Hey, girl.
X: Oh, Turtle Princess! This book is coming out awesome!
X: Oh, good, girl! I can't wait to read it!
X: Thanks, girl.
X: Goodnight, girl.
X: Goodnight, girl.
X: What's that?
X: 'Sup, LSP?
X: What're you guys doing?
X: We're carrying these rocks on an adventure, up to the Mystery Mountains.
X: Oh, nuh-uh, I am not gonna carry rocks!
X: That's okay. Jake can carry 'em.
X: Yup.
X: Ugh... Fine... You're welcome, Finn.
X: Ugh... My arms weren't meant to carry so many rocks, you guys!
X: C'mon, LSP. You can make it.
X: Uuoohhh... Turtle Princess, you can't call me! You're gonna blow my cover!
X: Good morning, girl.
X: Good morning, girl.
X: Would you be mad at me if I ask out Billy, that vulture who was hitting on you? I think he's cute and I would—
X: Hey, LSP, shake a leg.
X: The Loch of Phantoms. Princess Bubblegum said the rocks would show us the safe path.
X: Haha! Jake! "Ker-ploop."
X: Heh heh heh! "Ker-ploop."
X: Not... gotcha?
X: Alright!
X: Ugh! This place is plops, Finn!
X: We can meetcha back at the tree house later if you want. That weird light...
X: Hey, Finn! Finn, my dress is slipping!!
X: Huh? Listen, LSP, we've gotta be carefu—
X: No, LSP! It's not safe!
X: Heeeeeeey... Oh. Hey, Fiiiiinn...
X: She's stuck in there!
X: We gotta bust through this wall!
X: I knew you couldn't resist me, Finn. Aah!
X: That was so crazy! What just happened?!
X: Oh. Uh, Bubblegum sent us on a quest to destroy these cursed mirrors. Evil stuff happens when you look into them.
X: Oh, Glob... I had to look because I looked so good!
X: LSP... you don't need a mirror to know you look good. You're beautiful on the inside. Like... your brain and stuff!
X: Thanks for sayin' that stuff... and for saving me from those mirror-yous. That was pretty nice.
X: Okay. Time to write. Gonna make this... trashy. Turtle Princess'll be all, What's he doing out there?
X: Sometimes, after an adventure, he likes to sit out there and think.
X: Hello?
X: Hey, girl. Are you almost done with your book?
X: Oh... I'm working on it! I've been doing so much research!
X: Did Finn fall victim to your lumps?
X: Um... yeah...
X: Great! Bring in your manuscript right away! Click!
X: HE'S GREAT!
X: Uh... Bye, LSP.
X: This isn't what you said it'd be about...
X: I know, I—
X: I LOVE IT!
X: OH, MY GLOB!
X: Finn! You've probably been wondering where I've been for the last few hours!
X: Oh. Yeah! Yeah, I have.
X: Finn... I was never really your secretary, Finn. I was writing a book about how you were a slave to my lumps because I'm so hot, Finn!!
X: Oh. Okay.
X: But you're the one who's hot, Finn!!
X: Wow. Uh, thanks!
X: No... thank you.
X: LSP, YOU'RE WEARING GARBAGE FOR CLOTHES!!!!


=== S4E14 ===
X: Hey, Jake, what's wrong? You look dumpy. How come? Is it because of that metal box? Is something sad inside?
X: No. It's nothin'.
X: There's lots of boxes that have nothing in them, but also, you can put something in the box, and then it won't be empty. Does that make you feel better?
X: Ha ha. You're a charmer, Finn Human. No... it's... well... Lady Rainicorn doesn't wanna play the game Card Wars with me. I always beat 'er... so she says, "No more Card Warring."
X: What's Card Wars?
X: It's a fantasy card game that's super complicated and awesome, but—well... No, it's kinda stupid. Never mind.
X: How come you never talked about it before? It sounds cool!
X: Really? Well... I thought you'd say it was for nerds who do not know how life is outside of the nerd universe.
X: It is, man. But I still totally wanna play it. So no more moping, okay?
X: Thanks, Finn.
X: Oh, hey, BMO. You wanna play, too?
BMO: No. I do not play such games... with Jake.
X: What's that mean?
X: Ah, whatever. Let's play the game.
X: So what kinda stakes do we play for?
X: How about... the loser... is a dweeb, and the winner is a cool guy?
X: Those are good stakes.
X: Coffee ground, beetle butter, grape jelly, kimchi, and... this stuff.
X: Hey! You're ruining that pop with weird taste!
X: We drink when the game is over.
X: Oh, gross.
X: Now lemme explain the rules.
X: That's basically the basics! So once we have our kingdom set up... Hey, were you asleep?! I'll have to explain it all over again!
X: Doesn't matter. Let's just play.
X: But if you don't know the rules then you're gonna lose in the first couple rounds, like Lady always does! And then you'll hate the game, and then you'll hate me, and then... and then...
X: You think you're gonna win? I'm gonna crush you! Party-dance-style, dweeb!
X: Haha! Bring it!
X: So... how do I get my land on the map?
X: Oh... you, uh, floop your land cards.
X: Uh...
X: Keep those honeys hidden, or I'll get a strategic advantage!
X: Oh! Hmmm...
X: Okay, I go first. I floop the Silo of Truth!
X: Hey!!
X: Pfff, you got really lame cards. Hmm. I'll take the Cerebral Bloodstorm, though.
X: Huh?
X: Okay, now it's the battle phase. I'm attackin' your schoolhouse with my Husker Knights. So, what'll you use to defend?
X: Uh... Can my Cool Dog and Ancient Scholar defeat your Husker Knights?
X: Of course not!
X: Hmm. Then I floop the Pig.
X: What?!
X: What?
X: Okay... okay, first of all, you don't floop a creature to make it fight. You activate a creature.
X: Hmm. No. It says I can floop the Pig. See?
X: And, since I'm not actually attacking, your Cerebral Bloodstorm only does damage... to your own kingdom's troops.
X: You just wiped out my entire attack!!
X: What do you expect if all your power units come from corn? Pigs eat corn, dude. Cornfields stink.
X: CORNFIELDS ARE AWESOME! What makes you think you know so much about Card Wars?!
X: It's just logic!
X: ...Your turn.
X: Hmm...
X: You're supposed to discard a card and pick up a new one first.
X: Oh. Right.
X: Look at you. You're a babe in the woods. Your beginner's luck ends this round!
X: Hmm.
X: Spirit Tower?! And the Cave of Solitude?!
X: Now my battle phase begins. I activate my Ancient Scholar... to begin studying.  And I also move my Pig to the Cave of Solitude so he can take a nap.
X: That's it? You're not attacking?
X: I'll attack on a different turn.
X: HA! Then the seas have aligned and the five winds waft the smell of victory to my palace doors! I cast Field of Nightmares and activate my Legion of Earlings to scare your Pig to death!
X: My Pig's in the Cave of Solitude.
X: Um... I cast Teleport—to move your Pig to the empty field so I can attack 'im!
X: Uh... wouldn't Teleport only work on your own creatures?
X: You're right. I'm gonna slay that Pig, though!
X: How? You don't have any creatures that can touch 'im! Face it, man. I'm the cool guy.
X: Hmm. Heh heh heh heh... I floop the Volcano!
X: What?! That'll destroy your kingdom too, won't it?!
X: Hmm. Maybe.
X: Aah!! My Pig!!
X: My Husker Knights revive! And I still have my battle phase! Hiding in the Useless Swamp... the Immortal Maize Walker!
X: I LOVE CORN!
X: Cornfields give the Immortal Maize Walker triple damage.
X: Uhh...
X: I told you cornfields are awesome! Your Ancient Scholar and Cool Dog won't survive this time!
X: Actually, my Ancient Scholar's been studying the Raise the Dead ability.
X: So what?
X: So, my Ancient Scholar raises the dead. I floop the Pig.
X: NOOOOO!
X: Look! My Tower's doin' a thing!
X: HOMINY, HOMINY, HOMINY!
X: YOU GANKED MY SPIRIT WALKER! AAAAGH!!!
X: Uh... Maybe we should take a break?
X: Your turn.
X: Huh?!
X: YOU PLAY! YOU PLAY!
X: Oh, zing.
X: I do not play such games... with Jake.
X: Sorry! I gotta use the boy-style room! BMO! BMO!
BMO: BMO chop! If this were a real attack, you'd be dead.
X: BMO! Jake's acting banununununus!
BMO: Oh, no! Are you winning the game of Card Wars?
X: Yeah!
BMO: That's terrible! If Jake loses the game, he gets super depressed! When I beat him, he wouldn't talk to me for a month!
X: What?! I only played so he wouldn't be bummed!
BMO: Finn, you must take a dive.
X: Okay, I'll try. But... I'm a Card Wars super Amadeus!
X: Play. The. Game.
X: Alright, Jake. Prepare for my ultimo attack!
X: Well... I've still got my Wandering Bald Man. Oh, no.
X: I activate the Pig—to attack your Wandering Bald Man.
X: Well, that's stupid. Just attack with the Immortal Maize Walker and get the game over with.
X: No way! You've underestimated me and my Pig all day!
X: Please lose. Please lose!
X: Noooo!
X: I...
X: OHHH-HO! Ohhh, oh, yeah! Pigs can't leave mud landscapes once they're on them! Hahaha! The Pig is mine! First, I'll play Reclaim Landscape, then I cast Summon Archer Dan!
X: Whoa. Math.
X: My boys!
X: You have no creatures left. That's the game, boyee!! The five winds blow through cornfields once again! For the glory of Jakoria!
X: Heh. You got me.

=== S4E16 ===
X: Well, looks like your new house is done. Whoop! Jake! You wanna check out the new house?
X: Naah, don't let me interrupt you. You two have fun.
X: Great!
X: Finn!
X: Haha, I'm okay!
X: Hmmmm...
X: Oh! Do the thing that I like.
X: Now do the thing I like.
X: Hehehe, classic.
X: Thank you for building my new home, Finn. I'm so happy.
X: You... wanna hug?
X: Yes.
X: Woah! Hold on "mama."
X: Okay bro, tin foil's on. You can hug now.
X: Bye.
X: Bye, Finn.
X: Looks like your date went pretty good buddy.
X: Uh... I don't know, was the hug okay? Give me some tips man.
X: Bro, you gotta let things take their natural path. Look, look , where you touch her horn for the very first time. Very special.
X: What about Tier 15?
X: You stay away from that! Do not do Tier 15!
X: Dude, I got no idea what you're talking about.
X: Don't worry about it dude, just let things naturally move to Tier 2. Oh and um, you need a shower dude.
X: What?! Oh gross.
X: Do you think Flame Princess could smell me?
X: Probably.
X: Crup.
X: 'Sup, guys?
X: Princess Bubblegum?!
X: What are you doing here?
X: Collecting taxes, you guys weren't home. So I let myself in.
X: Oh.
X: I'm gonna take a shower. Princess, do not inhale!
X: What? Why?
X: Just don't. Hyap!
X: What's that all about?
X: Aah, he's just smelly from a day of running around with his lady-friend.
X: Ooh, a lady-friend, do tell.
X: Uh, I shouldn't say. It's his business.
X: Oh, come on, you can tell me.
X: That's his personal biz, you gotta respect the man's p-biz.
X: Okay, you're right, I'll respect it.
X: Flame Princess! He's hanging out with Flame Princess!
X: What?!
X: And I don't mean to be telling stories out of school. But pretty soon, they're gonna be taking it to Tier 2.
X: No, this isn't possible.
X: Oh, it's possible.
X: I just never thought, Flame Princess. I-uh-I have to go.
X: Morrow!
X:  Mmm, weird.
X: President Porpoise!
X: Oh gob, I thought I'd be ready for this.
X: Yyyaawn!
X: Finn!
X: Ok Princess, you need to stop breaking in here.
X: I have something important to tell you. About relationships.
X: Ah, that's okay, Princess.
X: I just hope, you'll understand. are like layers of sedimentary rock.......
X: Jake, Flame Princess is waiting for me. I'm gonna bounce out.
X: Uh, ok, Tier 2 baby!
X: Word.
X: If too much frustration builds, the magma will erupt causing a catastrophic super-stratum of igneous rock to form......
X: What? Where am I?
X: Jake, you're president now!
X: Oh my glosh!
X: Jake!
X: Wake up!
X: Jake, where's Finn?
X: He stepped out.
X: Will you tell him why he can't see Flame Princess anymore?
X: Oh, oh! I see what's going on here!
X: Great! I cannot stress how important it is that they not see each other.
X: Oh man, PB is totally jealous of Flame Princess!
BMO: Jump, punch, kick, kick!
X: What's up man?
X: Yo, dude! So what did Princess Bubblegum want?
X: She doesn't want you see Flame Princess anymore. She's crazy jealous!
X: So, you at Tier 2 yet?
X: I got about five hugs, does that count?
X: Nnoope.
X: Uhaah.. Well, I'm still at Tier 1.
X: I know exactly what'll get you Tier 2.... A "sappy poem."
X: Say something about her "spectrum."
X: Ee-eww! Let's see.... She's bright. She's beautiful. She makes me feel... confused, l-like something's filling up my chest, like I can't breathe, is it because she's so.. dangerous? Glob, Jake, I can't stand it!
X: Inspiration...
X: Finn!
X: Whatcha doin'?
X: Oh, uh, hi, Princess. I'm, uhh, writing something for Jake.
X: Oh, well, speaking of Jake. Did he explain everything to you?
X: Yyeah.
X: And you understand?
X: Yeah, I understand.
X: Finn, sometimes you want someone and you want to kiss them, and be with them. But you can't, because responsibility demands sacrifice.
X: What are you trying to say?!
X: I'm trying to say that you're a hero, Finn. You're my hero. So, I'm glad you understand why you can't be with Flame Princess.
X: Grr... Bubblegum! I can't do this anymore!
X: What?
X: Now you like me?!
X: Finn, what are you talking about?
X: What am I talking about?!
X: Oh, no!
X: Finn! Jake, where's Finn? Is he with Flame Princess?
X: Back off, Bubblegum! That's his "man's biz."
X: Is he with her?! Or not?!
X: What are you..? This isn't about some Her elemental matrix can't handle extreme romance! Glob, if Finn tries to kiss her, she'll burn so hot, she'll melt right through the planet's crust, down through the molten core, then she'll be thrown back and forth by gravity until she burns out the world from the inside! Why do you think I had her father keep her locked up?!
X: Will you take me to them?
X: Faster!
X: Ahhh.
X: No!
X: FLAME PRINCESS!
X: Finn!
X: Finn, there's no time! You have to...
X: Are you alright?
X: Finn!
X: Ohhh-tsst. Flame Princess!
X: It's hot!
X: Wait, wait! Don't move. This is good! If you stay on the hole for 24.8 seconds, the reaction will be deprived of oxygen. She'll go out.
X: Geh.. What about Finn?
X: Hey!
X: Huh, ummm.
X: Are you okay?
X: I'm okay. I'm okay.
X: She's stabilized. We're safe... for now.
X: Oh, Finn.
X: What?
X: Jeeeaalous?
X: Shut up.


=== S4E17 ===
BMO: Haha! Take that, Master Chen!
X: JAAAAKE!
X: What?
X: Jake, did you hide my sock?
X: No, man, I told you,
X: I don't do that kinda stuff anymore.
X: So, what? It just magically disappeared?
X: I don't know...
X: Maybe.
X: Is that just a cute way of saying you took it?
X: No!
X: Why don't you just help me find my sock?
X: Oh, Finn lost his sock! Everybody stop what you're doing and help Finn find his precious sock!
BMO: It looked like a tough case to crack. But I hate to see good friends fight.
BMO: So I decided to take the case.
BMO: Ronnie!
BMO: It looked like I had a guilty mouse.
BMO: Huh!
BMO: Hello, Ronnie.
X: What do you want, BMO?
BMO: Where is Finn's sock?
X: I don't know what you're talking about, BMO. I didn't do nothin'. Leave me alone!
BMO: How is Lorraine?
X: You stay away from her! She is with me now, do you hear?
BMO: Calm down, big guy. Me and Lorraine are dinosaur bones.
X: Good, 'cause I would be so jealous.
BMO: Just tell me where the sock is, and I will let you go.
X: I don't know, man.
BMO: What if I put some knuckle in your eyeballs? Would that help you think?
X: Ok! Ok! Umm...
X: It looks like a grape juice stain on his sock; check the pantry.
BMO: Maybe the grape juice had some secrets to tell me. Or maybe Ronnie was just pulling my hair.
BMO: Just as I thought, not even opened. I fell right into his trap.
BMO: Officer Davis! Thank goodness. I...
X: BMO, what are you doing here?
BMO: Looking for Finn's socks, same as you.
BMO Stay out of police business, or you will be the one behind bars.
BMO: She looked as beautiful as ever.
BMO: Where is the sock, Lorraine?
X: What makes you think I know?
BMO: I saw your lipstick on his fur, so don't act so cute.
X: Sounds like someone's jealous, no?
BMO: Don't count on it, Lorraine. Now tell me where Ronnie is.
X: Ha! You think it was Ronnie? Maybe if he was man enough to steal a sock, I wouldn't have to spend my nights with Bebe.
BMO: Bebe? So you're saying Bebe is man enough?
X: What? No, you're putting words in my mouth. Bebe doesn't know anything about Finn's sock.
BMO: Finn's sock? How did you know it was Finn's sock? I never said whose sock was stolen, Lorraine.
X: Uh... uh... I heard it on the TV news.
BMO: No dice, sweet beak. Officer Davis has this case under tight wraps.
X: Oh, fine, Bebe stole the sock. Oh, BMO, can't you just forget about it?
BMO: Sorry, lady, forgetting ain't in my job description. Ha ha ha!
X: Does that mean you still remember... us?
BMO: ... Hahaha! Same old Lorraine.
BMO
BMO: He yells at ladies!
BMO: Wake up, brainiac.
X: BMO? Uh...uh...auh!
BMO: Where is the sock, Bebe?
BMO ... I don't know nothing about socks!
BMO: Don't play dumb, Bebe! Don't play dumb with me!
BMO
BMO: I talked to Lorraine, Bebe. She sold you out, dumb dumb!
X: No! She-she wouldn't do that! It wasn't me, I swear! It was Ronnie!
BMO: Ronnie? But why?
BMO
BMO: I'm gonna go wash this shmutz off my grabbers. When I get back, you better start talking sense!
BMO: Sure, he's a dirt bag born out of a mother, but who's not?
BMO: I don't really get it.
BMO: Maybe it was time to cut my losses.
BMO: Come on, Bebe, let's get you cleaned up. Bebe?
BMO: Bebe! Dead. This doesn't look good. I'd better hightail it!
BMO: Huh? The cops!? It was a setup!
BMO: Bang, bang! Pew, pew, pew!
Jake BMO? Where's BMO?
BMO: Hello?
BMO: With the lipstick, she looked as beautiful as ever.
X: I'm worried about BMO.
BMO: This is real.
X: BMO!
BMO: Who's BMO?
X: Hello.
X: Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey, BMO. Wake up, buddy. Are you alright?
BMO: Neptr? I feel like I got hit with a Dracula by King Kong.
X: Whoa, sorry, man. You want some pie or something?
BMO: Sorry, I gotta run. The cops are after me. Have you seen any down here?
X: Nah, no one's been down here all day except me, you, and Ronnie.
BMO: What?! What was Ronnie doing down here?!
X: I don't know, but now my sensors indicate that some treasure is missing ...about a sock's worth.
BMO: That's it! That's why Ronnie took the sock: To carry stolen treasure in with! He had to whack Bebe to keep him from squealing, then he pinned the rap on me.
X: Bebe's dead?
BMO: Listen, Neptr: you better lay low for awhile. I'm gonna go find Ronnie . I've got a score to settle.
X: Hey, BMO. We should hang out more. We're both robots.
BMO: No, Neptr. I am not like you.
BMO: Ronnie?
X: Evening, BMO.
BMO . We found this confession on him after the shootout.
BMO: Hmmmmm...what about the sock?
X: Forget the sock, BMO. The case is closed. Let it go, buddy. It's over.
BMO
BMO: Lorraine!
X: BMO?
BMO: Get back here with that treasure, Lorraine!
X: Sorry, BMO. I earned this loot. Those chumps were not framing themselves. See you around, BMO.
BMO: Lorraine, wait! What about the sock, Lorraine?
X: in our secret, grown-up kissing spot. Remember?
BMO . Till next time.
BMO: Till next time, Lorraine.
X: Ya see, man? That was really fun. You don't need two socks to have fun.
X: Yeah, I guess. But maybe it woulda been more fun with two socks!
BMO: Finn, Finn! I know where your sock is!
X: Huh?
BMO: It was in your pillow this whole time! See?
X: Whoa haha! Right on, BMO!
BMO: Ronnie the mouse stole it, but Lorraine chicken set him up to kill Bebe, but the flatfoot busted Ronnie, and Lorraine skedaddled with the loot, but BMO solved the case!
X: Yay, BMO! Yay! Yeah!
BMO: Yay, BMO!
X: Yay!
BMO: Yay, BMO!
X: Our chicken's name is Lorraine?
BMO: She's red hot like pizza supper .

Eating a Christmas pie;
He put in his thumb,
And pulled out a plum,
And said "What a good boy am I!"

BMO: I'll be right back!
X: 자기 지금 뭐 하는거야... ("What are you doing, honey?")
X: Sorry honey, I'm on guard duty.
X: When your consistency is satisfactory, set mixture aside. Dip bread in the mixture and soak thoroughly. Heat your oven to a high heat and sauté your egg soaked bread slices till golden and toasted and serve hot with sugar, cinnamon sugar, jam, ice cream, meat, whipped cream-
X: The puppies aren't moving!
X: Perform CPR, they might be dead!
X: AHHHH! Saved 'em! Mom's manual knows best!
X: You guys are getting big! Okay!
X: This is a lot darker than I remember! Um, gimme a sec. Is this appropriate for babies?
X: Get that book out of here!
X: Yeah, okay. Sorry sweeties, Mom's manual says no.
X: 자기야, 애들 데리고 나가서 바람좀 쐬고 오지 그래? ("Hey honey, why don't you go outside and have some fresh air with the kids?")

X: 무지개 뱅! ("Rainbow Bang!")
X: Ya see, dad? We flippin' crushed it. Crushed it!
X: You did! I'm super proud y'all and I'm duper sorry too. I've been tryin' to make you know about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox.
X: 애기들아! 참 잘했어! 너네 정말 대단했어! ("Well done, babies! You were awesome!")
X: Yup! I've been tryin' to make them about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox.
X: Hey guys. I'm back.
X: Is everything okay?
BMO: Did you ruin it?
X: Nah, nah, it's cool. It turns out the pups can pretty much take care of themselves. They don't really need me around.
X: Oh.
X: Yeah. I guess rainicorns age really fast. They're basically like older than me already. Kil Whan has a beard now!
X: Oh!

X: Hey, I'm Randy.
X: Randy, wanna get dinner tonight?
X: Nah, I'm busy. I like to wonder at night.
X: Finn what's going on?
X: You gotta start calling me Davey, mister. Because that's my name!
X: Daaaaaaaaaavvvveeeeeeyyyyyy!!!

X: I'm a robber and I'm gonna rob this guy's life! And there's nobody who can stop me. Unless there's a hero around here. C'mon, Finn. Be a hero.
X: What? What are we talking about?
X: Butt out, Randy!
X: Uhhhhhhhhhhhh.........
X: Yes, Finn. Put on your awesome hat and beat me up.
X: What?
X: I'm not talking to you, Randy!
X: I called the police.
X: Wait, what?
X: Guys, it's not what it looks like! That guy isn't really named Davey. It's Finn! He brainwashed himself to become Davey and I was just trying to inspire him to go back to being Finn.
X: Yeah, yeah. We've heard that before. C'mon robber!
X: Finn, don't let the dragon drag on, man. Don't let the dragon drag on!
X: Don't let the dragon........ Jake!
X: Well that was pretty unusual, wasn't it, Davey?
X: Get outta here Randy!
X: No more Davey.
X: But you love being Davey.
X: I do love being Davey, but being Davey caused Jake to get arrested.
X: But remember that time when Davey sat in the park and saw some people walking around?
X: Yeah, that was nice.
X: And remember that time when Davey swept the floors?
X: Yeah, that was great, too. But-
X: Do you really wanna go back to being a famous hero? Why not just be Davey? A simple man... with simple goals and simple problems. You can just blend in and live the simple life.
X: Yeah.... Blend in. Y'know, maybe I'll be Davey just one more time!
X: One more time!
X: C'mon, man! That last game wasn't fair.
X: Who can hold up their hand the longest?
X: Okay, this game breaks the tie.
X: Okay.
X: Last game.
X: Last game.
X: Hey, fellas. How's tricks?
X: Hm? Oh, hey Davey.
X: Hm? What's going on?
X: Ah. Would you care for a body sweep?
X: Umm... yeah... sure. I do feel kinda dirty.
X: Whew! You sure know how to party, Davey!
X: Yes yes yes!
X: No no no!
X: Davey?!
X: No, it's me, Finn!
X: Finn!
X: Hey, stop!
X: Goodbye, Davey.
X: Goodbye, Finn.
X: Hey, there they go!
X: Yeah, there goes Davey and the criminal.
X: Good luck catching those guys!
X: Thanks!
X: Glad to have you back, buddy.
X: Word.


=== S5E10 ===
X: Woo! woo! woo!
X: I think the swimming hole's right around the corner!
X: Yes! Woo! Woo!

X: No fair! I have to take off my stuff.
X: Faster, we're getting a swirl!
X: You ready to get out?
X: Yeah, dude.
X: Let's get BMO to make us some sassages. Maybe with that one mustard? I'll use the Sassage Flare.
X: Hopefully BMO sees that.
X: Didn't Lady tell you not to use the Sassage Flare?
X: Yeah.
X: Well, don't abuse it man. 'Cause you're gettin'...
X: I'm gettin' what?
X: 'Cause you're gettin' fat.
X: Wah! Whoa...

BMO: Oh no! Get off of me!
X: Little Dude, no! You don't jump on heads. That junk is rude, Little Dude! You okay, BMO?
BMO: I am fine, Finn. I just thought you kept better company.
X: Sorry, BMO, he's just excited.
X: Sorry, Little Dude, but I have to eat.
BMO: Don't touch anything! I'm still frying up garnish!
X: Okay.
X: Yeah, okay.
X: Your head looks weird with short hair man, heh, heh, it feels like a peach.
X: Hey, Little Dude, y'all can get in on this if you promise to be good. Only good babies get sassages.
X: Nyang!
X: Hey, don't eat the—the food?
X: Dude, he turned it into poo! This is poo now—smell it!
X: Yep.
X: Little Dude!
X: Gotcha!
X: Oh, little Deezy. What am I gonna do with you?
BMO: You guys should get ready for bed.
X: Yeah, okay.
X: Oh!
X: BMO hit ya on the butt.
X: Nyang! Nyang!
X: Shhhh. Little Dude, you gotta chill.
X: Nyang. Nyang. Nyang.
X: Nyang.
X: Jake, wake up. Someone's on the house!
X: Tsk, it's probably Ice King again, dude. Man, we should tell him we know he sleeps on the top of our house. Oh.
X: He-ah-ha.
X: Ugh. No, no, no!
X: No, not on my head! Poo buns! Poo buns on my head! WAAAAAH!
X: N-Nyang.
X: Gross.
X: Ninja.
X: Eh?
X: Oooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
X: What are you doing in our house, homey?
X: Please don't hurt me! You're in grave danger and it's all my fault!
X: Wha? What are you talking about?
X: Your hat accidentally touched my head flower. See? I buried myself so that nothing would touch my body ever again, but then this bloom grew out of my head. C'est la vie!
X: Evil magic donks, homey.
X: I'm sorry, that's just the way my magic works.
X: Whoa, cool it, man. Let's just fix Little Dude.
X: Okay.
BMO: Guys! Your stanky friend jumped out the window and ran toward the Candy Kingdom!
X: Oh, hello. Aren't you a cutie! Hey, are you lost, tiny gentleman?
X: Nyang!
X: Nyang, nyang! Nyang, nyang!
X: Where is he?!
X: Little Dude! Little Dude!
X: Nyang.
X: Blisterin' beef!
X: Nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang!
X: No, Little Dude!
X: Nyang?
X: That's a bad Little Dude!
X: Nyang!
X: Aaah, horsey!
X: Little Dude! You were supposed to be my buddy!
X: All my fault. All my fault!
X: Oh, gleeble snoots!
X: How is he so strong?
X: Whomever the hat possesses gains the proportional strength of a hat! Look out! He's got the horse again!
X: Evil presence detected!
X: Sorry, fellas. I don't thrive in conflict situations!
X: Ow.
X: Evil.
X: Nyang? Nyang.
X: No! Not the Gumball Guardian!
X: Evil.
X: Nya-hang!
X: Na-yang!
X: Dude, use your powers!
X: I can't! All I can do is think about my papa and how much I disappoint him!
X: Just think of something positive! Something comforting!
X: Like... my mommy? When I came home with bad grades from wizard school, my mommy used to hug me, and hug me,
X: Uh, yeah. Just think about your mom and use your magic.
X: O-Okay, let's try this. I... love my mommy?
X: Hugs. Aw, I-I'll hug you. I'll hug you. Hug me.
X: I love my mommy! I love my mommy!
X: Hi, friends!
X: I love bein' alive!
X: Mommy!
X: I'm a window and I'll hug you!
X: Ditto about hugging y'all!
X: Mommy!
X: Ha-ha! I feel like huggin' everybody!
X: Hi, Mommy!
X: I'm going to hug you.
X: Mommy.
X: Heh, somebody... get this guy some clothes!
X: Now—now rise up, love buddies, and hug your gross brother into submission!
X: Gonna squeeze the heck out of him! I love that guy.
X: Nya-a-a-ang!
X: Come on, let's be pal-jamsas. P-Pal-jamas. Pajamas.
X: Thank you, my newly conscious bros. Now return your life forces to me.
X: I loved every minute!
X: Yay! Not living!
X: Nyang, nyang.
X: Ymmom!
X: Huh?
X: Poor Little Dude. He was just doin' it up the only way he knew how. It's not his fault he was created evil.
X: Yeah. He deserves to come back good.
X: Wizard, Mommy-magic this dude back to life.
X: Okay! Mommy.
X: Oh, my goodness! What is this lovely place?
X: Life, man!
X: I see.
X: And this dude is your pops.
X: No, I-I, ooh—I guess I am. Huh.
X: Be good to this dude.
X: I will. Way better than my papa was to me.
X: Yup, that's the idea. Jake, looks like I need a new hat.
X: Okay. Let's go skin an evil bear.
Episode ends


=== S5E16 ===
X: Uuf!
BMO: Uuf!
X: Come on, Jake...
X: Sorry buddy, just trying to cheer you up some. I mean here you are chillin' out with history's coolest friends, building an actual pillow fort, but you just sit there sulking--I mean, what gives!?
X: I guess I'm just thinking about Flame Princess. I told her a joke the other day and she didn't even laugh or anything. I guess it's over between us.
X: That's it?! A joke?
BMO: Maybe she just didn't get it yet.
X: Yeah right, BMO. More like she used up all her laughs on some other guy's jokes probably. Man, having a girlfriend is hard.
X: No! Being crazy is hard. You're getting all hung up, all hung up on imaginary problems. You gotta focus on what's real, man. Now it's gone forever. So it's not real, and I don't care about it anymore.
BMO: Oh no! My favorite window!
X: I don't even know what you guys are talking about. I think I just need some alone time.
X: Finn! Festering is always bad, man! There's no good kind of festering! Finn!
X: Man, this looked smaller from the outside. What's this now? What the?! Jake, what's in here?! Jake?
X: Oh, whoa! Did Jake build this part too? That guy needs some more girlfriends or something.
X: Hey Jake! You need more girlf--what the...? Door's gone?
X: Hmm, maybe there's another door in yonder pillow town. I don't get this at all.
X: Dragon!! Blanket Dragon! Run!
X: Huh?
X: Oof! Hey mistah, you betta get wunnin'! Bwanket Dwagon!
X: Now this, I understand!  Oh. That's it?
X: Wow.
X: Did you see that?
X: Hey, uh, how's it going?
X:  Puhoy there! I am Quilton, son of Pillowford, and you have saved our village! You and your sharp pillow.
X: Hah, it's nothing; I kill things all the time.
X: Oh, nonsense! This calls for a celepillowbration!
X: There you are, Finn the Human.
X: Oh, hey there... Um, you can just call me Finn if you want.
X: All right, Finn. My name is Roselinen, daughter of Quilton. You have to call me the whole thing.
X: Oh, uh...
X: Just kidding!
X: Heh. Oh, uh, your dad seems fun.
X: Oh, ha ha, oh my! Puhzah!
X: Yeah. Um, you wanna dance?
X: Oh, well...
X: Dummy, it's a dance, not marriage.
X: This place is weird.
X: Are you telling me that birds in your world don't poo little pillowcases?
X: Naah, just regular poo.
X: Hey, like this.
X: Eh, yeah, i-it's really cool. Where I come from, I live with my best friend, who's my brother. And he's a dog. We fight stuff; it's cool. It's really different than here. I mean, where I'm from, blankets and pillows are used for bedding.
X: Well they're used for that here too.
X: Heh heh uh.
X: Woo oo ooh hoo hoo! Pill-ightful!
X: Ah man, it's been nice, Roselinen. But I gotta get back to my home. Quilton, I need your help to find a portal to my home world.
X: Of course, we will do our best to help you, Finn the Flesh Pillow. But you're not making a fold of sense!
X: Please, share our food. You need nourishment.
X: It tastes... like... a pillow...
X: I'll give your compliments to the pillow.
BMO: Oh, there you are! You found your mug. I thought you said you didn't care.
BMO: That mug is empty.
X: I wonder what Finn's up to...
X: Roar! I'm the Blanket Dragon!!
X: Well, I'm daddy! Sha-pow!
X: Jay, Bonnie. I bet your dad's just about finished chopping wool. You guys wanna bring him his lunch?
X: Yes!
X: Daddy!
X: Oh! A pack of fearsome pillow goblins?!
X: Ha ha, daddy, we're your kids!
X: Psst, Finn, they've brought you lunch.
X: Oh, they have, have they? Tiny pillows. Mmm mmm mm mmm.
X: Darling, you've outdone yourself.
X: Honk, honk!
X: Grandpillow!
X: What's my father doing here?
X: Puhoy!
X: Grandpillow!
X: Oh oh oh, come here! Oh, but I've come to speak with your father.
X: What is it, Quilton?
X: When you first arrived here, you told us of a mysterious door that led you to our world.
X: Yes, of course.
X: The Pillownomicon.
X: Oh my glob.
X: There is no information about the door, save for the fact it shows up periodically, and then disappears.
X: Quilton, I need to find that door.
X: Uhhh, hey BMO, I gotta snag my mug from you.
BMO: Oh, really?
X: Hey don't sweat it, I'll make us some hot chocolate.
BMO: Jake, you drive a hard burger.
X: Hello?
X: Ah yes, come in.
X: Are these The Great Abracadabra Mountains? And are you Rasheeta the Great Oracle, dweller of said mountains?
X: Yes, you must be Finn the Human Man, seeker of the wandering portal.
X: Yes, I've searched for decades--how did you know?
X: I've read it in the Tea Leaves, this newspaper I found from the future.
X: Does it say how I get home?
X: are you sure you want to?
X: Uh... yeah!
X: Well don't worry, you won't be here long.
X: So there is another way to... Oof...
X: Not long now.
X: Oh...
X: Father?
X: What did the oracle say, father? Have we come to the right spot finally?
X: I think so, but the oracle spoke in riddles. Gonna have to fester on this one for a bit...
X: Oh, Finn. I know you have to go, all these years I've known, but now that it's time... when you're back in your real life.
X: Hmm, that reminds me, Roselinen, of something Jake told me just before I came to this world.
X: You're getting all hung up on imaginary problems, stay with your new wife. You've known her longer now than any of us. You're not even sure if I ever really existed. And I'm pretty sure I didn't look like this.
X: Come on, everyone. Pack your things, we're going home.
BMO: Ha ha he, ha ha he, goodness, Jake, why don't you do this with your other babies?
X: Well, Rainicorn babies age rapidly. They don't need their parents a couple hours after they're born.
BMO: That really stinks, huh?
X: Mmmmm.
BMO: Hot chocolate is ready!
X: Finn... Finn.
X: Wha—where?
X: Are you comfortable?
X: I'm... alright.
X: Um, dad...
X:   That... we love you dad.
X: I remember... back... when I was dad.
X:   Dad, you are dad...
X: HUP!
X: Hey buddy, you feeling better already?
X: Huh? Oh. Uhh, I don't know, man. I just had the number one wildest dream.
X: Really?
X: Yeah! I was-- That was Flame Princess. She said she didn't get my joke until just now and that it's really funny and awesome!
BMO: . Ha ha! I knew it!
X: Yeah, that's great man. Now what about this dream?
X: What dream?
X: The dream you were just talking about.
X: Huh?
X: Just a second ago!
X: The dream you just had in the pillow fort!
X:   Pfft!


=== S5E17 ===
BMO: Aaaaah!!
BMO: Oh no, it's crazy far. Okay, now easy does it. Easy...easy..."
X: Hey man it’s safe in here!! You can hide in here!! Oh, shoot man, uh ooh.
BMO: Eeeeeh! so, this is the pits.
X: I hear that, friend. Do you mind if I wallow with you a bit? I'm a bubble.
BMO: Okay, nothing stopping a bubble.
X: Looks like you've given up on things. I'm thinking about giving up on things myself. I've been lost in this wilderness a long time. Maybe you and me can wait here, to get eaten by a carnivore!
BMO: No, Bubble. I know two heroes who can help you!
X: You do?
BMO: Yes! Help me get to my home, and, and we will help you find your home!
X: Your friends sound great!
BMO: They are! They are huge!
X: Well then, what are we waiting for?
BMO: Nothing!!
X: Hey, so tell me about your home, BMO.
BMO: I live in a tree house it's really funny.
X: Cool.
BMO: Yeah! What about your home?
X: My home? I think that my home is very large and very beautiful. But I can't pin down these memories it... haunts me.
BMO: Oops, I wasn't listening to your story.
X: What was that?
BMO: It's a carnivore waiting to eat us.
X: Nooo!
BMO: Don't worry Bubble,
X: What's a baby doing in the wilderness?
BMO: He must be lost like us! We should take him with us. Maybe we can help him find his home, too. What a handsome baby. Handsome baby.
BMO: Bubble, what do you think our baby's name is?
X: How about "Sparkle"?
BMO: No, I think he looks like a "Ricky."
X: Hmmm.
BMO: Oo, Bubble! Ricky! Look! I have a bad news: the bridge doesn't have guard rails.
X: I don't think we should cross it then.
BMO: I don't think we have any choice! I really sure there really is a carnivore this time! Ricky, you should go first.
BMO: Okay, Ricky, slow and steady, Ricky...Ricky?
X: Ricky! Sparkle!
BMO: Oh nooo-o-o-o!
BMO: One second, sweetie! Hmm, a deadly water fall!
X: BMO?
BMO: Bubble, you have to save our lives!
X: Eeeeh... maybe I can, hold out this leaf.
BMO: Thank you Bubble! I think my batteries are wet.
BMO: Oooo, good morning everyone, I didn't have any dreams.
X: He looks fussy; maybe he's hungry.
BMO: My hungry baby, what am I going to do with you?
BMO: Potato.
BMO: Eat your potato, Ricky!
BMO: It's the carnivore! Everybody! Hide! Psst, Ricky! Please, hide!
BMO: Oh, Ricky. Help me out here!
X: My baby!
X: I was so worried about you, Sparkle!
X: Sparkle...
BMO: No, Ricky! No, no no! No, no!
X: BMO, that's his mom! Let go!
X: Hey, the path ahead looks pretty clear and there were these... uh, there... BMO, are you okay?
BMO: I am sad, Bubble. I miss baby Ricky. I miss him so much already. And I miss Finn and I miss Jake. And I got dirt all in my butt circuits! And Bubble...
X: Yes, BMO?
BMO: I-I don't think I'm ever going to get home again.
X: a strapping horse whisperer or a sexy hitman or whatever. And things are looking up for us, too; I saw some bugs up ahead who look pretty with it.
X: Maybe they can gives us directions or something.
BMO: Oh, my gosh! Oh oh oh! Bubble!
X: What?!
BMO: I know those guys, Bubble! Those are my homeboys, my homeboys, those are my homeboys! We are close to my home!
X: Yeeah! Come on, BMO!
BMO: Yeah!! Yeeaah!
BMO: It's been so long, I can't wait to have some bread-and-butter!
X: Jake, is that you at the door?
X: Naw, man, I'm in the kitchen making us breakfast.
X: I call 'not answer the door' then.
X: Um hey, so, BMO, since we have a little time, there is something I've been wanting to say.
BMO: Hm?
X: I know I might never find my real home.
BMO: No, Bubble, that's not true!
X: It is, I know it is, but it's... it's okay, because I realized something, all this time we've been together, BMO, I haven't felt lost, I felt at home.
X: And, it's you, BMO, I feel at home with.
X: So, I thought- I mean if you feel the same way, I thought we could get married. I-I mean... I'm not even sure what that means exactly but-
BMO: I do! Oh, I do! I do!
X: Hey, a bubble! Pop!
BMO: Bubble? Bubble?
X: What's so funny?
X: Oh, it's just BMO, he's pretending to be all messed up because his bubble got popped.
X: Oooh, heh haha, that is pretty funny.
X: There, there, BMO, it's okay.
BMO: Bubble? Is that you? I hear you in my head but I don't see you!
BMO: Oh no, have I gone bananas?!
X: No, BMO, it's okay. You see, I'm finally free.
BMO: I don't understand, Bubble.
X: No, not Bubble, Air. BMO I'm Air! I've been trapped in that bubble for so long I've forgotten who I am, but now I'm finally home.
BMO: Yeaay!! Oh, b-but wait, now you don't need me... to feel... at home.
X: Nooo, see that's what's so great. Now we can be together forever, BMO, every minute of every day. No more privacy, no more quiet, no more alone. Every room you ever go in, I'll already be there... waiting... forever and ever, until the end of time.
BMO: Yaaaaay!!


=== S5E19 ===
X: Whoa whoa whoa.
X: BMO, what's wrong?
X: I think he broke his egg.
X: Hey, it's okay BMO. Look, Jake and I will make you a funny face.
X: Hey, BMO, this will cheer ya up!
X: Well, I'm outta ideas. What?
X: James Baxter! James... Baxter!
X: Oh, man, James Baxter is so good, man. He always knows just what to say to cheer a guy up!
X: Yeah, man.
X: So good!
X: Man, we should do it to! Do his thing and spread the good will!
X: Yeah, man, I wanna be like James Baxter, always rollin' in on a beach ball, saying his name in a horse voice, making people smile. Let's do it!
X: Yeah!
X: Finn the Human!
X: Jake!
X: Finn!
X: Jake!
X: Sheesh, tough crowd.
X: I think we should find an easier person to cheer up. It was a mistake to visit a funeral.
X: Eh, what do you want?! Please, I'm just a very sad girl!
X: That is so perfect!
X: Yeah, man, so unique!
X: James Baxter! James Baxter!
X: Man, what's he doing that we're not? We just gotta figure that out.
X: No, it's like, he's shredding on a guitar and learning how to shred isn't just copying the exact notes as someone else's solo. You need to learn how to do your own solo.
BMO: Why am I recording?
X: You're documenting our creative flow in case we make a breakthrough.
X: Dude, I think we do got something.
X: Let's check the video.
BMO: Bathtub, Bathtub!
X: Alright, BMO, play the video.
BMO: Who's gonna scrub me?
X: I'll scrub, you take notes.
X: Yeah, right there, speed it up.
X: Slow it down.
BMO: Yeah, that sounds makes me feel happy!
X: Good, good, happy is what we want.
X: BMO, zoom in on my mouth
X: Yeah, it's good, but if we want to be "James Baxter" good, we gotta to go deeper.
X: The Institute of So Und.
X: Hey, hey man!
X: I receive you. Welcome to the Sound Institute of So Und.
X: Where is the studio to make the best feel-good sound?
X: Just think happy thoughts and follow the beat of your heart.
X: Hold up.... This way...
X: Look at this tricked out studio! Half stacks! Full stacks! Oooh, distortion pedals!
X: These sounds make feel-good, right here.
X: Right here. Good!
BMO: I feel it here, good here!
X: We know to figure out how to make our sound... force happiness into the listener!
X: Check our data?
X: Maybe it should be higher?
X: Yeah, maybe, maybe it could be lower, I don't know.
X: See that sound? I drew that sound connected to two other sounds.
X: Hmm, something's missing.
X: That's it, the missing thing in our thing!
X: Yeah, James Baxter don't just got his catch phrase, he has his beach ball bizz!
X: So we gotta create feel good body actions to go with our feel good sound!
X: We just crushed it, homie.
X: Dude, seriously, I think our thing is gonna change the world. When people experience it, it's going to make them so happy!
X: Let's just do it.
X: Yeah, man, yeah.
X: Wha—.
X: No no no, wait a sec! Reserve judgement until you've see the freshed-up version of our thing.
X: We did it!
X: What's wrong?
X: We're bummed.
X: Oh my!
X: Let's just do the thing.
X: Right, okay!
X: Dude!!
X: WHY HAVE YOU UPSET MY DEAL?!
X: Jake, come on man, I need some help!
X: Sorry, I act like a little kitty cat!
X: Whoa, it's milk!
X: Eeeee, he broke my squishy bones!
X: Don't worry, Jake, I'll block this one!
X: What?
X: It's just that there are a lot of dead people there, we might get separated. I'll be the one going
X: Holy cow!
X: Well, sort of.
X: Yeah, we know him!!
X: What's his deal?
X: His name's James Baxter, he just travels around on his beach ball making people happy.
X: James Baxter!
X: Cool.

X: "When did you make your sign?"
X: "Last night when I saw you writing yours".
X: "You fancy a wager, buddy?"
X: "Bringeth it on, sir!"
X: "Whoever talks first will be really disappointed"
X: "Can we use signs?"
X: "Yes, but only the ones we write in the next thirty seconds"
X: "... of the breakfast, I mean".
X: "the juice?", "the toast?", "the jam?". "the Tea?"
X: "Hi, Jake"
X: "You didn't write enough signs, did you dummy?"
BMO: Finn, Jake, I invited some Bikini Babes over to dance to this song! Um, why are you not talking?
"Me too".
BMO: What?
BMO: Oh oh, what should I do?!
X: BMO?
X: "Don't touch my signs".
X: "Of course not, man".
X: BMO, BMO are you home? BMO, we're here to dance with you!
X: "Jake, what are you implying? That I would touch your signs after being expressly forbidden to do so?".
X: "about BMO?"
X: "What?"
X:  ???
"BMO we love you we're Finn and Jake for real! We're not talking today because we're playing a game! We love you!"
BMO: No way fake boys! I am never coming out!
BMO: Bikini Babes! They're not Finn and Jake! Get them!
"OUCH", "OW", "HEY".
"the jam?".
X: Ow, ow! Okay fine! Uncle uncle, please stop pinching me Bikini Babe!.
BMO: Finn? Jake? For real?
X: We were just playing a game, BMO. It all started this morning when Jake made a sign that said-
BMO: Oh, I don't care. Let's just-a party!
X: Party, party, party! Ooouuuu!
X: Armen Mirzaian 1977-2013. "Aw c'mon"


=== S5E23 ===
X: Nice. Little bird family on vacay. Dad's got the mad beautiful tail feathers; Mommy's taking up the rear all plain-jane styles.
X: Hey! Don't be talking trash! Our ladies are beautiful on the inside, you creep.
X: All lady birds around the whole world are beautiful on the inside?
X: Yes.
X: Fair enough.
X: Special delivery for Jake the Dog.
X: Cool, thanks. Urgent.
X: Hold still, BMO.
BMO: Ouch. I hurt my butt sledding.
X: Aw dang. Sorry, BMO. Cool, man, I'm excited!
X: What the heck am I looking at?
[The bag from the person's head is removed, revealing it's Jake Jr. Jake spits out all the peanuts from his mouth.
X: Jake Jr.?! What's going on here?
X: Jake the Dog, we have your daughter. She is safe—for now.
X: What do you want from me?!
X: We need you to reassemble your old team—Gareth, a.k.a. The Lady Master, the Flying Lettuce Brothers, notorious con-men impressionists and your old friend, Tiffany.
X: Glob it.
X: You'll need them to break in the Royal Candy Vault and steal this.
X: The Baker's Shard—the purest source of sugar in the known regions.
X: You're the only master thief with the skills to swipe it. You have until midnight to make the drop. Tell anyone and Jake Jr. gets it.
X: BMO, destroy the tape.
X: Are we on the level, BMO?
BMO: I ain't no clown-town snitch, baby.
X: I don't want Finn hearing about this.
BMO: Alright.
[Jake stretches his arm into a hole in the wall and presses a button.
X: Oh Branard, you sure?
X: Yup babe, I'm totally famous and you love me.
X: Wha—what is going on? What am I feeling now?
X: You are now under the spell of my face. I got you, girl, in my face trap and you love it.
X: I do. Branard, don't ever leave me! I'll give you everything—my fabric, my dress patterns, my marbles, my social standing—
X: Woops! I gotta go! Laters!
X: Dine and dash? I saw that!
X: Hey boss, I wanted to—
X: Shut up Tonya, I gotta see my ex-wife!
X: Uh.
X: Hello, Squeez-E-Mart.
X: Tonya, this is your boss!
X: Wait, you were just here.
X: Yeah, and now I'm on the phone, stupid!
X: Hey, do you think I can leave early? I'm like, depressed.
X: What you could do is take all the money from the register and give it to the two guys out back by the dumpster.
X: OK. Can then I go?
X: Yes.
X: Here you go dudes.
X: Thanks, man.
X: Peace.
X: Goodbye, fair lad. The master returns.
X: Well, well. From the shadows of dream, the dog wakes to find its—ugh—
X: Oh, hi guys. Were you waiting for me in the dark?
X: Tiffany wouldn't let us turn them on.
X: Never mind that, the real question is what's that slo-mo Finn know about this?
X: Hey BMO, where's Jake?
BMO: Jake got back with his old gang and is going to rob the Candy Kingdom!
X: OK, BMO.
X: You wanna join my primitive noise band?
BMO: No, I like organized sound.
X: Pssssh!
X: Nah, BMO's covering for me.
X: So what's the deal, Jake?
X: Yeah, why did you call us back?
X: I got a job for you guys. One last score. The Big one.
X: The Baker's Shard? Are you for real, man?
X: "Play it safe."
X: Can't ya see guys, he's desperate! Somebody got to him 'cause he's soft now.
X: What? Psssh! Tiffany! I'm the same Jake, I just stopped stealing mostly! 'Cause when you get older you're supposed to get in other stuff, like graphic design, or pottery. It's called "growing up"!
X: I don't want to do poetry—I mean, pottery.
X: Dude, you guys on board or what?! You really got something better to do?! I know you don't, Tiffany!
X: Glom you, Jake.
X: How are gonna split the Baker's Shard?
X: We ain't keeping it. I'm passing the shard off to a mystery dude.
X: What the—?!
X: The dude has my kid.
X: I'm in.
X: We're in.
X: I know that vault inside and out! Every guard rotation, every camera, every deadly trap. And that safe is locked up so tight it makes me wanna spit out my guts and cry about it. Do you even have a plan, Jake?!
X: I have the first part. OK, let's freakin' do this!
X: Captain, the milk delivery has arrived.
X: Well, check 'em in, Private.
X: Yes, sir!
X: And Private, I'm very thirsty! Bring me back the most delicious flavor they have!
X: Yes sir!
X: Huh? Now what in the heck—?!
X: I got your milk, sir!
X: What flavor did you bring me, Private?
X: Banana, sir!
X: What?
X: Banana milk!
X: The forbidden flavor! It's—delicious.
X: Attention all guards! You are directed to report immediately to the courtyard for special training!
X: OK, do your thing, man.
X: Just like old times, right, Jake? When we were blood, we'd follow each other in the jaws of death on a pale horse.
X: Not now, Tiffany! Come on!
X: Tonight we'll be working on our battle "kee-yahs." Alright men, sound off!
X: Alright soldiers, time to shred those pipes! I wanna hear you scream!
X: Louder! Push it hard!
X: The Baker's Shard is on the other side of—that. The Corridor of a Thousand Deaths.
X: I did it! For Jake Jr.!
X: Stop right there.
X: You! Where's my daughter?!
X: Throw me the Baker's Shard—and I'll let her go.
X: Yeah right, that's super-dumb.
X: Daddy! Please do what he says!
X: Hang on, sweetie!
X: Thank you for saving me—
X: —daddy!
X: You dirty—
X: Now—ugh—
X: Oh crud! Jake, I love you! I love youuu!
X: Shut it, Tiffany! Gimme my daughter.
X: TADA! I totally double-crossed you!
X: Jake Jr.?! WHAT THE PUKE, GIRL?!
X: Let's get out of here!
X: What the funky fresh, honey?
X: I just wanted to be like you. Mom told me stories about when you did crimes.
X: That was a long time ago. Before I knew it was wrong!
X: I thought you'll be proud of me.
X: I am. I couldn't have done that when I was your age.
X: I age fast remember? I'm twenty-two!
X: R-r-r-right. I keep forgetting maths.
X: What are you going to do about the old crew?
X: Finn and I bust their apples tomorrow. Or maybe the Banana Guards will get 'em.
X: Come on. I'll take you home now.
X: I love you, pops.
X: I love you, too. Don't stinkin' do this to me again. I'm old and fat. I'll probably have a heart attack.
X: OK.
X: Wait a minute! You're doing a long con right now, aren't you?
X: No.
X: Yes.
X: Now I'm really proud of you!


=== S5E24 ===
X: Oh, hello again! As you can see, the bird-house is nearly complete! All that's left is where the door hole goes. But I can't remember. Yeey! Here we go!
X: You having fun at daddy's?
X: Hm? Oh. Sure dad.
X: OK. You seem kind of dump trucks.
X: What?
X: You know, "in the dumps."
X: Oh, sorry. It's cool. I'm just thinking about the future, I guess. We're on, like, the bleeding edge of history. Everything ahead of us is totally unknown and there's no guarantee that things are going to be all right. It's exciting, but it's also pretty scary. You know?
X: Sounds like my little baby girl wanna build a time machine!
X: Ooooh!
X: Guys, I don't—
X: No, no, no. Leave it up to your daddy and uncle Finn! Yup.
X: OK, you guys have fun! I'm gonna get some more juice.
X: Pssst. She's going back!
X: Hello? Oh! Is that the machine part that I ordered?
X: Ac-cept-tance.
X: Guys, I'm basically thirty. I'm not a little kid anymore!
X: You're not a little kid anymore!
X: WHY-Y-Y-Y!?
X: Cinnamon Bun, you can't sleep with a night-light anymore. You're basically thirty—it's starting to bum everyone out.
X: I can't handle this denial of light!!!
X: Yeah, well—
X: Oh. A-ha. OK. This is nice.
X: Ah! Too dark!
X: Hey, Cinnabun!
X: I—need—soft—light! Yeeargh!!
☐ Clean
☐ out

X: Ah! Nothing like a hard day's work to get them spirits a-lifted!
X: Season 1"!? Isn't this that show that everyone is talking about? I heard that this show is really good for penguins. Wow, that's really lucky for you guys, I'm a little jealous. Well anyway, good luck to all our nominees! OK, all in favor of "Blimby's "WHO GOTS DA ABC'S""—raise your hands.
X: OK, all in favor of "Baby Ballet"—raise your hands.
X: OK, all in favor of Air—What!? "Baby Ballet"? Come on! Ugh! I should have never given you penguins the right to vote. Well, you may have numbers on your side, but I still have one trick up my sleeve. Bargaining. Whereby, you let me watch "Basic Mortality," and I in return will do anything you want in the whole world. How 'bout it?
X: Wenk.
X: Algebraic!
X: I know he was your partner.
X: Enough! Alan is not the super-murderer!
X: I don't know about this show though—
X: This, captain, is the most lamentable super-murder I've ever seen—and I've seen plenty.
X: —might be a touch too dark.
X: Hm-m-m.
X: Hm.
X: Oh, little Lemon-Sweets, our son. Go to bed.
X: No, he wants to dance!
X: Brother, stop that!!
X: We hate you.
X: The end! My end!
X: My end... table, my love seat, yeah. Gee but it's great to be back home. It's always a blast visiting my cousin, city-Fox, at his future palace, but you just can't beat that old country steez. City-Fox's digs be mad sterile. Look a this. This was my grandpa's rug. Some bums let him have it 'cause it was so ugly. Man, I always did have the ugliest bugs. What are they doing? Selling each other houses?
X: What the—? Oh, no! My riches!
X: Cinnamon Bun, you! Did a great job, on this hole wall. It's very rustic.
X: M-m-m-m, what a jerk.
X: What, a jerk?
X: Yeah, just give it a little jerk.
X: Now that's a time machine.
X: Hey, sweetie! Sweetie, look! Your time machine's all ready!
X: Aw yeah, you havin' fun, dad?
X: Aw, anything for my baby pup.
X: OK. As long as you're having fun.
X: Ha-ha! There it is! You see? The birdhouse door—it's right above the peg thingy. Why didn't I think of that? Well, let's get right to it, then. Ha-ha.
BMO: Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger!
BMO: Excuse me.
X: HEY, why are you trying to steal my dad's stuff!?!
X: Hey, I need a night-light because I'm so scared!
X: Man, you can't steal, dummy.
X: Fine! Here. NOW GET LOST!
BMO: Jake Jr., I'm sorry for messing up your time travel.
X: Aw, that's OK. It was just make-believe, anyways.
X: O-ho-ho, was it? Then how do you explain tomorrow's newspaper?


=== S5E25 ===
X: SLAM!
X: Hey! I was trying to read that!
X: That book is above your level.
X: What business are you into?
X: None of your business!
X: Talk about it over lunch?
X: Heh, if you're buying.
X: Hey!
X: Hey!
X: Fight!
X: Ahh! it's terrible!
X: Lumpy Space Princess!
X: Whats wrong?!
X: You guys! Somebody stole something from me! Something I can't live without!
X: I'll get something to calm her down.
X: I've been robbed! I've been robbed!
X: Out of the way!
X: I need help! Can you guys hold her down?
X: Do something! I've been- ooh!
X: Oops.
X: LSP! Who robbed you?
X: I think I gave her too much.
X: Jake. A crime has been committed. We must find the criminal.
X: We must.
X: And retrieve whatever it is that was stolen from Lumpy Space Princess.
X: Clues, clues, clues.
X: What's that? I can't see it.
X: Oop, sorry. Aah!
X: There's something in her hand! A key! A key to...what? Three zero three. Hmm.
X: Ah! Looks like we've got our first lead!
X: Hmm. Find anything, Jake?
X: more bags. But no leads on Pete something.
X: Start marking evidence.
X: Hmm.
X: Hmm.
BMO: Hmm.
X: Is this blood?
X: Yeah man, that's definitely blood.
X: Hmm. LSP's injuries were 100 percent emotional. So it has to belong to Pete Sa-something. BMO, take a sample and do a full blood analysis. Hey, if that guy cut himself during the robbery, he might have gone somewhere to buy a mini adhesive bandage. There's a drugstore across the street!
X: Woah!
X: And if the oozing persists, just come back and I'll give you something a little stronger.
X: Hello, citizen. Had anyone in here looking to buy some mini adhesive bandages today?
X: A lot of people come through my store, gentlemen. You can't seriously think I'd be able to remember any one particular customer among the countless others I see on a daily basis, now, can you?
X: I guess not. Fair dues. C'mon, Jake.
X: He didn't buy it though. He always thought it had-
X: Ma'am, can you give us a name?
X: Mmm, nope. No wait, yes I can. Pete Sassafras.
X: Did you catch which way he was going?
X:27, Candy Kingdom Station, Platform 5. Heh. Sorry, I wish I could remember more.
X: See anyone who might be our guy?
X: What the-?! Jake! What's with all the turning into stuff today?
X: I really like turnin' into cop stuff. I literally can't stop turning into cop stuff. I see a nasty tranch!
X: Let's book him, son.
X: Stop right there! What's under that skeezy trenchcoat ya-
X: Busted! For attempting to board a train without a ticket.
X: Oh, guys, he's getting away!
X: We're not criminals, man! We're working the beat, just like you!
X: Jimmy?
X: Yup. Checks out. He tastes like police.
X: Sorry about that, officers, it was an honest mistake.
X: Ugh. We lost him.
X: Not yet we didn't!
X: Ugh! It's too far ahead! We'll never catch it.
X: If we cut through the forest, maybe we can head it off at the pass.
X: Sweet thinkin'.
X: Yeah!
X: Are you Pete Sassafras?
X: Wha-? Uh, I got a lot of names. Who's askin'?
X: Give back what you stole from LSP!
X: Who? What's that, an acronym or somethin'?
X: Cuff 'em.
X: Ehh, I got this. busted.
X: Alright, you listen, flatfoot. There's been some kind of crazy mistake here. I didn't do nothin'!
X: Save it for the candy judge, Pete.
X: Look, you can cut the act and drop the sass, Sassafras. We've got an eye-witness and your blood at the scene of the crime.
X: You do the crime, you do the time, man!
X: Roll the dice, you pay the price.
X: What dice? Oh, you guys are donkers.
X: Burgle our friend, it's the end. For you!
X: I wanna see a lawyer.
X: I'll handle this, Pete. You're upsetting my client. Just look at that face. That constitutes harassment, so give him some space. Don't worry buddy, I got this case.
X: Welcome to the next twenty-five years of your life.
X: We deserve donuts.
X: Let's ball.
X: No, wait, please! You guys!
X: Guilty!
X: Man, we didn't just crack that case, we crunched it! Crumbled it!
X: We are awesome at being cops! No question about that.
X: Call me crazy, but I was thinking maybe we should actually become detectives. Like, as a job! When we were out on the streets back there, getting those leads, busting that perp, it just felt so...I don't know...right.
X: I know, man. I actually totally do know exactly what you mean.
X: I have a problem. I can't stop!
BMO: Howdy, partner.
X: Oh hey, BMO. What's going on?
BMO: I finished processing the blood sample. And I have the result.
X: Nice!
X: Yeah, good work, BMO!
X: It's Pete Sassafras's blood, right?
BMO: No. It doesn't belong to anyone because it's not blood. It's tomato sauce.
X: Tomato sauce?
X: Hmm... Oh my mind! LSP wasn't trying to say "Pete Sa-something"; she was trying to say "Pizza something!"
X: But how would pizza sauce end up in a hotel room?
X: Unless it was delivered.
X: Pizza Sassy's!
X: Where's the delivery guy?!
X: Oh, you mean Petey. He's out. He's makin' deliveries.
X: Or maybe he's out tying up loose ends!
X: LSP could be in danger!
X: Danger!
X: Phone?
X: Phone.
X: Princess! Have some Banana Guards outside of LSP's hospital room!
X: Huh? Why?
X: LSP could be in danger!
X: LSP woke up and went back to her hotel room.
X: OH MY JAM!!!
X: He's already here!
X: Can I help you?
X: It was you! You did it!
X: Help me! I was just delivering the pizzas she ordered. And now she won't let me leave.
X: LSP, what is going on? You said he stole something from you.
X: He did! He stole...my heart!
X: Hurry up, dude!
X: Shh!
X: Right.
X: Thanks!
X: Shh. Go, go!
X: Yeah, no tip, huh? That's great. That's how it is, around here. Fine.
X: Huh, huh? Come on pal. Turns out the only case here is just another case of LSP being nutty!


=== S5E27 ===
X: Yup! Yeah, totally stuck that landing!
BMO: Yeah! Woo woo!
X: Man, it's been so long since I've worn the Jakesuit. I forgot how awesome your bod is, bro. Stretchy-arm power! BMO, throw your plate at me!
BMO: Okay!
X: Yeah, BMO, show me the stuff, keep it coming! Yeah, BMO, unleash the beast!
BMO: Yah! Unleash the beast!
X: Come on, BMO, bring it, that's nothing! You're weak, BMO!
X: You OK, BMO?
BMO: I am no match for the Jakesuit.
X: That's right!
X: Dog, the Jakesuit is mad strong! This junk could protect me from anything!
X: Uh, sorta. Wait, bro, what are you doing up here? You know I'm not actual armor, right?
X: Septuple flip off the tree house!
X: Nooo!
X: Ride 'em cowboy! Woo!
X: You were a little rough with the Jakesuit today, bro. You mashed up my doggy bag pretty hard.
X: Why didn't you stop me?
X: When you're in my body, it pushes out my brain, so I have no control.
X: C'mon bro, taking pain is easy. You just have to imagine that every bruise is a hickey from the Universe. And everyone wants to get with the Universe.
X: I bet you wouldn't be saying that nonsense if I wore you as a suit.
X: I bet I would be saying that nonsense.
X: OK bro, let's see how you like it. I'll bring the pain!
X: Do it bro, get in here!
X: Haha yes! Time to bring the pain!
X: Eh?
X: Man, are you kidding?
X: You give up?
X: You have to like, punch me in the face.
X: Hmm. I thought I was. This is hard. I can't even make a fist. How do you control my body so well?
X: Dude, I'm graceful. Mom raised me graceful.
[Jake grunts while making Finn's hand into a fist. He raises it and moves it towards Finn's face. Before he can punch Finn, the hand turns into an open palm and merely lightly slaps Finn.
X: Dude, what the Bjork?
X: A-ha! Here we go! Dream Journal of a Boring Man, Volume 12.
X: Uh, Jake, what are you doing?
X: There's all kinds of pain, Finn.
X: Dude, come on, don't do this.
X: Ah. Okay, let's see. Ooh, this one looks good. And it's not too long, only seven pages! "In my dream, I was eating jasmine rice. But it was also brown rice. And it was also my mother."
X: Huh? Where am I? Oh, yeah. Hey, Finn, how long have I been out?
X: I don't know. A couple hours
X: Say what?! Why are you still reading?
X: It's actually not that bad. There's a bunch where he knows he's dreaming. Here, let me read you a little. It's like he's trying to solve a mystery that doesn't exist! You want me to keep going?
X: No, I'm hungry.
X: Yeah, I'm hungry too. How about a truce while you go make us some lunch?
X: Oh, I didn't know we were allowed to call truces. I'll totally remember that the next time my doggy bag is hurtling towards a fence post.
X: You know, you could use the opportunity of cooking me food to mess with me.
X: Wait a sec, you just gave me an idea!
X: Yeah?
X: Ta-da!
X: Meatloaf? That's my favorite dish.
X: Mmm-mmm.
X: What did you do to it?
X: I assure you, it's delicious.
X: Okay, well, you're really terrible at this.
X: Yummy!
X: Oh, that's just mean.
X: Admit you're wrong, and you can have some of this delicious meatloaf!
X: Nah, I'm good.
X: Jake, it's my special occasion phone! Someone's calling me to tell me about a special occasion.
X: So?
X: So can you walk me over there? I wanna see who it is! I'll talk to her later. I don't want you embarrassing me or, uh, anything. Jake?
X: Jake! Seriously, don't do this!
X: Tell me I win, dude!
X: No, absolutely not.
X: Alright. Say goodbye to Flame Princess thinking you're cool! I'm gonna embarrass the Bjork outta you!
X: Oh, hey, you came! I got worried because you didn't answer special occasion phone. My relatives are waiting inside.
X: What?
X: Well, that's why I called on special occasion phone. All my less-evil family members are here for dinner. Come eat!
X: Finn, this is my family.
X: Jake, whatever you're about to do, please don't do it.
X: What are you doing in front of my family?!
X: Hold on, bro. Perhaps it is a non-flameish custom unknown to us.
X: Nope! Just doin' the kind of stuff I do all the time!
X: This is a nightmare come true for me, sister.
X: What are you doing?!
X: Don't you wanna see more?
X: Oh, my Bjork! No! I don't want to see more! Wait, what's that in your mouth? Jake?
X: Oops! Busted.
X: Are you controlling Finn?
X: Yeah, I'm causing Finn pain. We have a bet going on.
X: And you made him dance like a baby, semi-nude, in front of my family? Wow, that's pretty hardcore.
X: What?
X: Good luck, Finn. Hope you win!
X: I will!
X: Hmm!
X: Finn! Oh, of all days! Where are you going? Jake, where are you?
X: I'm right here.
X: Oh!
X: 'Sup?
X: What's T.V. doing here? I thought all the kids found apartments.
X: No matter what, I think he's stay-at-home.
X: Ha-ha! That's my boy. Momma's basement baby.
X: Jake, what are you doing? Please tell me.
X: Oh, it's this bet we're doing. It's not really a bet. It's more like a showdown. I'm trying to get him to admit that it's hard when someone wears you as a suit. How do I win the bet, Lady?
X: Hey, Dad? Why don't you try jumping in a volcano?
X: Yes!
X: So, what are we doing, bro?
X: The Universe is going to have a full-on make-out session with you, bro. I'm talkin' minimum tier 8. Behold!
X: Fire Wolves? That's your plan? Please.
X: Oh no, bro, that's just fortuitous circumstance! Allow me to take advantage! here, pup pups! Want some kibble? Want steak flavor? Steaky-steaks?
X: How you like it, bro? Pretty painful, huh?
X: Eh, whatev.
X: Hmm. Looks hot.
X: Oh yeah, bro! The pain-train has arrived at the station! Choo-choo!
X: I'm ready, bro! Bring it! You're nothin', lava! You're a bum! I can handle you!
X: Look, just say stop, and you won't get burned.
X: Never!
X: Okay, bro. This'll pretty much wreck up your whole life, so think about it.
X: Bring it! Yeah, baby, feels good, love it, lovin' that heat on my skull!
X: Okay...I'm gonna lower you some more...probably gonna cook up your brain.
X: Oh, yeah, give it to me!
X: Dang, he's flippin' crazy! This isn't gonna do anything, he's never gonna give up!
X: What happened? You robbed me of the win!
X: You're right, man. My bruises are hickeys from the Universe. And I should just accept that.
X: Yeah boy! In yo' face!
X: Yeah, in my face.
X: Dangit, Finn.
X: Who's ready for rehabilitation?
X: We'll start with full-body immersion therapy.
X: No!
X: Yes!
Episode ends.

BMO: Hello?
X: BMO?
X: BMO?
X: BMO, are you okay?
X: What did you do?
BMO: It wasn't me. I didn't do noth- do noth- do nothing.
X: Come on BMO. We got to get you to the hospital or whatevs.
BMO: No, no. I am fine. Really. Oh, yes. Okay. Please take me to get fixed. I need- need- need- need to get new core system drivers installed. We can get them at the MO Factory in the Bad Lands, where I was born.
X: The MO Factory?
BMO: Yeah. I am programmed with emergency instructions to get there. Come on! There's no- no- no- no- no time to lo- lo- lo- lo- lose.
BMO: Okay. Now straight down this place. Okay, now take a right- right- right- right- left up here. The instructions also say that damaged MOs get a full memory-wipe before repairs. Don't let on what happened... or all the years we've been spent together will vanish like tears in the oven!
X: Tears in the oven? !
BMO: Yeah, no fooling. Oh wait, there's more! It says here only MOs are allowed in the factory. Wait what? Oh, that's just great.
X: Hey, hey. Don't worry buddy. We're Finn and Jake, remember? Or should I say... Finn and JMO!
BMO: Wow!
X: Hey BMO, check this out, too! Meet FMO.
BMO: Finn, you're dumb- you're dumb- you're dumb- you're da man! This is gonna be a snap!
X: Hello, there.
X: Greetings, and welcome to MO Co. I'm DMO. Please state your business.
X: Hey there, DMO. I am JMO.
X: And I'm FMO!
X: Greetings, JMO. FMO, you look ridiculous. Are you damaged? Are you in need of repair?
X: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, DMO. I busted my core system drivers, and now I need new ones.
X: Fantastic. Okay. Please get ready for your total personality wipe.
X: Oh, right, right. Uh, right. I mean, no. I'm just here for the... nostalgic purposes.
X: Ah, yes. 47.3% of MOs eventually return to the factory for assorted sentimental biz. Please step 100% on the ultra-tram for your complimentary tour.
X: Greetings.
X: Wup!
X: We are now passing over the famous factory floor. Birthplace of each and every MO. Behold the gleaming machinery! Teeming and wild with the throes of real creation. From this unlikely chaos emerges every shiny new MO.
X: But nothing's moving down there. It's all shut down. What happened to this place?
X: I'm sorry. I'm just a tram MO. I'm not programmed to understand that question. Also, you're just a JMO. You're not programmed to ask that question.
X: Uh, what question?
X: That question-
X: I'm serious...
X: Anyway, MO Co. was founded over 1,000 years ago. By Moseph Mastro Giovanni. A sad and gentle man. Beloved by only those he built to belove him. On your left, you'll see the core system driver installation port bay.
BMO: Finn! Finn! That's it! That's where the driver ports are!
X: I know, I heard!
X: What?! Are you crazy?! Get back here!
X: Hurry, Finn. I think he's calling the police or somethin'!
X: None of these ports fit right! E, D, C, where's the B port?!
X: Intruder spotted! Prepare to vaporize! Vaporize!
[The four SMOs shoot lasers into the room. Finn and Jake jump behind some wreckage to protect themselves.
X: Cease fire! No intruder spotted. Vaporization complete.
X: Um, but what if they slipped past us, sir? In all the smoke?
X: Allllright, everyone. About face. Like I said, vaporization complete. Now let's head back to base. It's donut o' clock.
X: Man, how about those goofs? Tryin' to mess with our drivers?
X: Yeah. You know the world these days. All goofs.
X: Hey! You toss me one of them 'nuts? Ah. Yeah, hey, speaking of goofs? Haven't seen SMO 5681 lately.
X: Man, that goof.
X: Yeah, I hate that goof. You ever notice goofs always askin' how you're doin'? What is that? Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
X: Yeah, 100%.
X: Oh! Hey, what are you doing over there by yourself?
X: Uh, oh, I-- I'm sad.
X: Oh, yeah, y'know we've all been there. So anyway, how's your goofy wife doin'?
X: BMO, how are you doing?
BMO: Get me close to that guy's port. I can hack into his computer and find out where my driver port is!
X: Ah, we gotta hustle!
X: Yeah, pretty good, I guess. I prefer something yeastier. The wife is always giving me grief about that. But I mean, what am I, decent?
X: Hey, what are you two goofs doin'? Goofing?
X: Dang, man, how deep does this place go?
X: Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down. Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.
X: Psych!
X: Hey, woah!
X: Down that grate!
X: Hey! Only MOs are allowed in the facility 1,000%! Get off of my tram!
X: Cram your tram! Womp!
X: Hang in there, BMO!
X: Hey, Jake! Can this thing go any fast-
X: Woah! Shoot, it's the fuzz!
X: Hit 'em again!
X: Holy-
X: Finn, how are we getting to BMO's driver port?!
X: Uh, turn right!
X: Dog it, they're still behind us!
X: Turn left!
X: Turn Corkscrew!
X: Now go down!
X: There's a driver port!
X: Too spicy.
X: My bod!
X: Non-MOs are forbidden in this facility!
BMO: I am not non-MO.
BMO: I am BMO!
X: BMO.
X: BMO? Did I hear BMO?
X: Wait, what's up?
X: Hey, I'm Moe! Don't worry! My legs don't work!
X: You're Moe?! Wait, are you human, too?
X: My skin is human!
X: Dude, how old are you?!
X: Hey, come on, now! Hmm.
X: So...you made BMO?
X: Hey, you're not gonna reset our friend's personality, are you?
X: Huh? What? No...BMO's one of a kind. I built BMO to take care of my son. Hoping to find a family home. And then maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of.
X: Aw.
X: Oh, there's that back-up driver disk!
BMO: Ooh! Are you my grandpoop?
X: Nah, I'm just your poop.
X: Wait, did you say you built a million robots?
X: Yeah, all we saw was that tram jerk and all those jerky security jerks!
X: Ah, those were just the surface jerks. BMO, say hello to your family.
BMO: Hello, family.
X: Hi, BMO!


=== S5E32 ===
BMO: Sumo Scootz! Winner!
X: Whoo! 79th consecutive victory! Still bummed out about Flame Princess?
X: girl's night out, boy style! First, we'll go to the salon, get yo hair did and your nails all—wait, no. First, we'll go to the shops, get you a brand new hat. Then, we'll— A burgler-mer!
X: Aah!
X: The Ice King? Grr—eh!
X: Jeez, you couldn't wait two seconds?
X: Ech. Why are you stinkin' up our house?
X: Didn't you get my text? It said I'm stayin' oh, didn't go through. Well, anyways, I knew you wouldn't mind since it's sorta your fault I'm homeless, right?
X: Right.
X: 'Cause you tricked your crazy ex into meltin' my Ice Kingdom?
X: Mmhm.
X: With your lies and secrets? 'Member when that happened?
X: Dude, you can't stay here if you're gonna stank it up with your bad vibes, man!
X: Yeah, I'm just crashing here while the penguins rebuild. I've given Gunter temporary reign.
X: Should be fine.
X: Flame Princess isn't crazy.
X: You're blind, Finn. You're blind—wait, she isn't here, is she?
X: No.
X: Whew!
X: She said she wanted time to herself.
X: Yeesh.
X: Yeah, breakups are tough.
X: Heh, yeah, like, remember how you and I were married?
X: Uh! It's so confusing!
X: Hmm? I thought Finn was a stand-up guy, you know? But he basically betrayed me.
X: Why do people even have secrets?
X: It's like that in the Fire Kingdom, too. Everyone is all deceitful and Shakespeare. But out here doesn't seem any different. And what is that noise?! Grrr!
X: Eh.
X: Yeah, yeah. Just act like I'm not here.
X: Are you spying on me?!
X: What?! No, of course not!
X: I was observing you—for research. You're a threat, Flame Princess. Your emotions are directly linked to your combustion levels. But if I can create a scientific model that describes your complete elemental matrix, I can isolate and suppress your more... volatile traits.
X: So, if you do your research, you'll know how to cut off my emotions so I won't feel like this?
X: Umm, yeah, basically!
X: Then I'll help you.
X: You will?
X: Yes. I'll do whatever it takes.
X: Once I press this button, you'll be subjected to a battery of tests to gauge your reflexes, stamina, and your reaction to various emotional stimuli.
X: This is going to help me understand myself?
X: There's a 40% chance we'll be able to identify and isolate your chemical components—and yes, understand you in a very scientific way.
X: Oh. That's good... I guess.
X: Initiate test. Hello?
X: Princess! We need you and your Ball Blam Burglerber right away! Gunter has created a race of strangling snow snakes, or snow-a-constrictors!
X: Aaaah—
X: Okay, Cinnamon Bun, all you have to do is write down the numbers that appear on this monitor. Can you do that one thing?
X: Yes.
X: write down the numbers, do not open that door. Got it?
X: Yes, Princess.
X: Hello.
X: Hello.
X: You look sad.
X: Yeah, but mostly I'm confused.
X: Ha, me too.
X: Really?
X: Yeah. Bubblegum is bad.
X: She is?!
X: I don't know. Wanna pet my dog?! He lives at my house.
X: What about the tests?
X: I'm not good at tests.
X: La-de-da-de-da
X: We're friends.
X: Yeah, I really get you, but sometimes friends are hard to understand. Sometimes you think you know them, but you find out they're just playing mind games.
X: Is the princess your friend?
X: I don't know.
X: Yeah, because why did she lock you up in jail when you were a little baby? That was a weird friend thing.
X: The word! The word!
X: What's the word?
X: The word is your newborn baby will have greater powers than you'll ever dream of.
X: Uh... have my baby sent into the wilderness of the outside world to perish.
X: Okay!
X: Oop. Hup.
X: Ah!
X: Ho-ho!
X: WAAAAAAAAAH!
X: Ca'tle.
X: What's this?
X: Kih, kih.
X: A princess? Must've wandered off.
X: Flame King?
X: What do you want, princess of the Gum World?
X: I found your lost daughter.
X: I-I don't remember losing anything.
X: Pssh.
X: Okay, you got me. I had her sent to wander in the woods. I was in fear of being usurped. Come on.
X: That's your problem, but you can't just let her run around the woods. She's too dangerous. Find some way to contain her power, or I will.
X: Pssh, fine.
X: Is everybody in this world hiding something?
X: It's fun to hide.
X: You're all right. Why can't everybody be honest like you? Maybe I should just go back where I belong.
X: Wait, do you mean baby jail?
X: I don't know, man.
X: Mmmm...
X: Fighting snow-a-constrictors really helped take my mind off things.
X: So, uh, why am I here again?
X: Oh, I just wanted to measure Flame Princess's reaction when confronted by the guy who broke her heart.
X: Hey, Cinnamon Bun, I'm—
X: CINNAMON BUN!!!
X: There's a note "Gon 2 fyr kingdum. Pleez watch dog."
X: Oh, this is terrible! If Flame Princess goes back there, her evil dad will lock her up again!
X: And if she's imprisoned, I won't be able to complete my tests, and I'll have wasted my precious time!
X: We gotta save her. Let's doogie!
X: State your business here, and be quick about it. Sorry, I'm on edge 'cause I'm worried that Jerry here will find out I'm dating his sister.
X: Listen, we need to get into the castle right now.
X: Yeah, but why?
X: Grrr! So I can go to your mama's house! Now get outta my way!
X: Doesn't your mom live in a nursing home?
X: Yeah, and in a different city. C'mon, dude, you gotta be honest here.
X: Honest my fist! Come on, Princess!
X: D'aw, yeah! Gonna scramble you and fry you up for brunch! I try to act tough but I really wanted to be a chef.
X: Man.
X: Halt. What is your business here?
X: I need to get inside to file my taxes. Also I like using the bathroom here. Also I like to crop dust the lobby.
X: Pass, friend.
X: Alright, so you wanna get nasty? One time, I blew a snot bubble that broke off and floated away. Then it hit some lady's baby in the face, and it started crying.
X: And I really enjoy the taste of envelopes.
X: Uh, that's cool and all, but you still haven't told us why you want to get in.
X: We need to see the king?
X: Well, why didn't you just say so? Right this way, friends. the new Flame King.
X: Flame Princess?
X: Finn?
X: You're okay! Um, how's it going?
X: Pretty good. Cinnamon Bun and I staged a coup and I overthrew my dad.
X: Oh-ho, that's why the guards were wigging out.
X: That is the new way in the Fire Kingdom. Total honesty is the law of the land—no secrets.
X: Oh.
X: Right, can you believe this nonsense? Once I get outta here, I'm gonna ground you for real. No snacks, no friends, no popular music.
X: You never let me have any of those things! You were a selfish king and a bad parent!
X: But I did it for you, honey—for you not to overthrow me like you just did.
X: You belong in that lamp! And if you don't settle down, you'll have to answer to Cinnamon Bun!
X: Hi.
X: Wow. She's even awesomer than I remember.
X: Take off that silly hat. We're going home.
X: No. Look, got a real dog now! Hah.
X: Flame Princess, listen. I'm really sorry I lied and hurt your feelings, and I was a big fat jerk—
X: Finn, it's okay. It's in the past now.
X: So, does that mean we're still going out?
X: No. I've realized my place is here, ruling these weak and vicious Fire People.
X: I see.
X: But we're cool. You're welcome to come back and hang out whenever you like if you promise me one thing.
X: Anything.
X: That you'll be completely honest with me.
X: Heh. Okay. I promise.
X: I'm serious.
X: Hmm.


=== S5E33 ===
BMO: Ha-ha! I win!
X: Oh, hey, man.
X: You and BMO play Finger Spread quietly. I need to get into the zone. I am ready to receive instruction from the realm of creation above me for the sandwich I am about to conceive. I am open; use me.
X: Diced boiled eggs! Bird from the window! Yeah, baby, now we're rollin'! Whoo!
X: Common cucumber! Sliced Roma tomato. Sweet yellow onion—organic. this is the greatest sandwich I've ever made!
X: Is it glowing?
X: You guys want some?
X: It's cool, man. I know you want to eat the whole thing, and I'm cool with that.
X: Thank you. Magic Man!
X: Magic dog! I'll take some sandwich!
X: You stay away from my woman! Eh, my sandwich!
X: Sandwiche! Mijo! Magic Man! My sandwich!
X: That's a good-looking sandwich.
X: What are you gonna do with it? Something gross?
X: It's got my germs, so it's mine now.
X: NOOOO!
X: Dead arms!
X: Give it back, you animal!
X:20, when green leaves turn brown, the only way forward is down. Then you'll see, the wetter, the better.
X: That's not even a riddle! It's wordplay, at best!
X: You try and come up with something on the spot! It's hard!
X: Ow!
X: Now to savor the moment.
X: What the?
X: Jake, wait!
X: What's he doin' in there? Why did he freeze himself with my sandwich?
X: He's not frozen. He's super slow-mozin', motion. Look.
X: Aww, that's gross!
X: Well, let's go grab it before he hits the ground, which is when I assume he'll take a bite.
X: Yeah, okay.
X: Hmm.
X: Oh... hey, Jake.
X: Hey, Finn.
X: How long have we been in here?
X: I don't know.
X: Retreat!
X: Whoa, how long were we in there?
BMO: Five hours.
X: Five hours?! He's halfway to hittin' the ground... which is when he'll bite my sandwich, probably.
BMO: Yes.
X: BMO!
BMO: I agree that is when he will probably take a bite.
X: You're not helping.
BMO: Oh, you need help? I can help. Processing.
X: Must be his new software.
BMO: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Ding! I have the solution, Jake.
X: What?! BMO, are you serious?
BMO: Yes, this plan will work.
X: Yes!
BMO: But we have to hurry.
X: Yes!
X: Alright, BMO!
X: Wait, wait, wait. BMO, are you just making a skateboard video?
BMO: No, Finn. This is the plan.
X: Are you sure?
BMO: Jake, you will have your sandwich back before my board hits the ground.
X: Okay, BMO.
BMO: Yay, BMO!
X: He lied to me.
X: Relax. I'm calling Princess Bubblegum. It's ringing.
X: Okay.
X: Thanks again for coming, Prubbles.
X: Of course, Finn. Once you explained about Jake's sandwich, I had to.
X: So, how's it looking?
X: I'm picking up major levels here.
X: Of magic?
X: Molasses.
X: Oh.
X: He's using a molasses-based super-covalent subatomic bond, slowing down anything that enters its field, but only if the molasses is at room temperature. Hmm, this one. My molasses warmer will get things moving.
BMO: ...iiiiiiiii...
X: Well, I'm out of ideas.
X: Who ya calling?
X: Marceline.
X: The vampire queen?!
X: Oh... maybe... maybe it's just as good!
X: See, I think the molasses must be protected by some sort of chemical—
X: Oh, hey, Jake. How you holding up?
X: Not too well. BMO looks cool, though.
BMO: ...iiiiiiii...
X: Don't be sad.
X: Yeah, Marceline's got a great plan.
X: Yeah, man!
X: What's your plan?
BMO: ...iiiiiiiii...
X: Hey, man. What are you doing?
X: I'm lighting these candles so I can move on with the grieving process. I made them with the leftover bacon fat from my sand—
X: I am not giving up. Let's see. Who should I call? Ice King? Shelby? Tree Trunks?
X: Tree Trunks?! No, man, don't call Tree Trunks! What's she gonna do, bake an apple pie?! Don't you get it?! It's over. It's over, and I've never been so sad. And you know what? I got to deal with it.
X: Jake, look!
X: Hmm? What? But how?
X:20, or as some people call it, a sad face.
X: What?! Nobody calls it that.
X: Nope! No! Don't get judgmental.
X: Stay sad.
X: Right.
X: Jake, every time you get happy, you slow down! Stay sad, man! Make yourself sad!
X: Uh... okay!
X: 제이이이이크!(Jaaake!)
X: It's okay, Lady. You gotta let go. He's gone now. Let me take you out for a coffee... get your mind off things.
X: 컵케이크 씨, 정말 고마워요. 당신은, 정말 좋은 친구예요. ( Mr. Cupcake, Thank you . You're really a good friend.
X: Hey, Lady, I'm here for you. Don't you ever forget that.
X: Hey, Mr. Cupcake, you stay away from Lady!
X: No, man! Stay sad! Make yourself sad!
X: Uh...
X: I, I love you, Jake. We should have hung out more.
X: What? Um, I love you too, Mr. Cupcake. I didn't want to hang because I thought Lady was into your muscles. And I thought if we'd hung out, you'd sweet-talk her and take her from me.
X: What? I would never. I've got so much respect for you.
X: Dude, I have so much respect for you! I try to be like you in some aspects of my life! Look, if something were to happen to me, and I wasn't here anymore, I'd want you to take care of Lady and the kids.
X: That means so much to me. I wish we had more time together.
X: Yeah, Jake! The wetter, the better! Keep crying!
X: I'm sorry, Mr. Cupcake!
BMO: Boardslide!
X: Yay!
X: I got you, baby. This sandwich is so good!


=== S5E35 ===
X: If I hear another peep, there's gonna be trouble! Final warning. Okay, go ahead, BMO.
X: Okay, welcome back to the program. We're talkin' with our special guest, Finn the Human.
X: Hello.
X: Now, Finn, before the break, you were sayin' somethin' interesting—that you're gettin' outta the romance biz. So, what happened?
X: Well, I don't want to bore your listeners...
X: But let's just say the time has come to stop dating princesses... and return to savin' 'em.
X: And you're not just sayin' that to, uh— make yourself seem more attractive?
X: Yeah, of course. No games goin' on here.
X: Hold on, hold on. What's that noise?
BMO: I think someone's knocking at the door.
X: Can you see who it is?
BMO: Yes, Jake.
X: So, it's goin' pretty good, huh?
X: Yeah, but maybe we should stop talking about this "love" junk and get back to adventuring.
X: Finn! Jake! I need your help; it's an emergency!
X: Now we're talkin'! Don't cry, Slime Princess. We're at your service.
X: I need Finn to marry me.
X: I'm sorry, SP, but I've given up the dating scene.
X: You don't understand. If I don't get a husband, I'll lose my kingdom.
X: I'll do it!
X: What did I tell you?!
X: Please let me explain.
X: Recently, my much hotter younger sister, Blargetha, married a Slime rogue named Guillermo. As a result, Elder Plops decreed that if I was not married by tomorrow, rule of the Slime Kingdom would pass to my sister...
X: ...which I'd be, like, totally fine with...
X: Except, I recently discovered they are both evil. Evil to the core! They plan to militarize the kingdom and begin a campaign of aggressive conquest,
X: Ew.
X: Finn, this will happen unless someone marries me.
X: No.
X: Hmm!
X: Please, Finn. I know I've crushed on you in the past, but I have no intention of locking this down. Our marriage will be in name only.
X: Hmmm...
X: Aw, who ate all my popcorn?
X: You call this a room? There's not even a window. Oh, wait. Are we rolling?
X: Alright, now it might.
X: We're here. Welcome to my little oasis in the wasteland.
X: Oasis? More like, "No way, sis!"
X: Huh?
X: Whoa! This is amazing! You okay, buddy?
X: You could say I got out of there in the "lick" of time. Zing!
X: Quickly. We're already late. This is the most important place in the kingdom.
X: The royal palace?
X: No, it's where me and all my main splurts hang out. Hi, girls!
X: Hi!
X: Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig, what are you doing here?
X: Oh, we always come here when we want to shake it, Finn. It's the only triple cray-rated disco in all of Ooo.
X: Get your face pretty, Finn. My people are already assembled in the courtyard. Greetings, loyal slimejects!
X: I would like to introduce my new husband, Finn the Human!
X: What did I tell you? Piece of cake.
X: Attention, my loyal slimejects!
X: And that's the mysterious Guillermo. He hails from a faraway, much more somber Slime Kingdom where people have strange customs and no love in their eyes. Their discos aren't even rated one cray.
X: My husband would like to say something. And, uh, he would, too, if not for his extremely sore throat. So I will say it for him. We challenge you to the Trials of Glarb.
X: I object! Ancient traditions such as the Trials of Glarb are no longer relevant in our modern self-indulgent society.
X: Order, order! I demand order. I, Elder Plops, being the coolest guy in the room, will settle this dispute. The matter will be settled on the battleground...
X: Alright!
X: ...the battleground of love.
X: Aw.
X: The couple that I deem most truly in love shall rule the Slime Kingdom for life.
X: This is, like, the opposite of what you wanted.
X: Welcome to the Trials of Glarb, hosted by me, Elder Plops. The first trial will be Crooning. You guys are gonna get into these sweet boats I made and croon for each other on the lake. The most loving and heartfelt song, judged by me, Elder Plops, will win.
X: I really want to hear some emotional song work here. The people want to hear emotional stuff. So let's see some stuff, alright?
X: Okay, Finn, you can do it.
X: I don't know. I'm still jacked up over my lady biz.
X: Well, just lose yourself in your own mind and go numb. Then let it all out.
X: Eh. Why can't I get over you?
X: Finn, way to go. I could tell the people were really impressed. Guillermo, you're up.
X: Hmm? Okay, Guillermo. I'll ask, I'll ask. Uh, Guillermo still has a sore throat! Uh, may I sing on, uh, his behalf?
X: Elder Plops thinks that's okay.
X: ♪I want to touch your hand with my hand. I want to rub your cheek with my cheek. Maybe later we can get "Do not disturb."♪ I'm done!
X: As Elder Plops, I have heard many songs in my life, and I can only say this... Finn, you win this one.
X: Hooray!
X: Whoo!
X: Yes!
X: Welcome, everyone, to our second trial... Spooning. When I say go, the big spoon will put his arm around the little spoon and cuddle. I will be watching you spoon, measuring and assessing your love by posture and overall vibe. The best cuddle, or spoon, wins.
X: Wait, what?!
X: Spooners, get in your futons.
X: Uh, I don't feel good about this.
X: Ready, set...
X: Spoon!
X: No, wait. I don't wanna do this.
X: Wrap those gorgeous pythons around me!
X: No! This feels weird!
X: Come on, Finn, they're crushing us!
X: Huh! Huh! Huh!
X: Blargetha and Guillermo, very nice.
X: Nooooooooooooooooo!
X: Yeesh. Alright, everyone, stop. I've seen enough. Blargetha and Guillermo's love was way-off-the-charts good. They win.
X: Yes! I love you, baby. You spoon so good!
X: No!
X: Smooching. I'm sorry it doesn't rhyme with Crooning and Spooning. We will begin our next trial on the morrow!
X: This is not going well.
X: I'm sorry, Slime Princess. I'm just gonna mess this next trial up.
X: Is it because you haven't done much kissing? You don't have to be embarrassed by your innocence.
X: Pretending to be in love is making me sad. It makes me think about Flame Princess.
X: What If I pretend to be your ex?
X: That's worse, I think.
X: Well, it looks like I'm losing my kingdom to the forces of evil.
X: Mmmm.
X: Bunk this.
X: Wait! Where are you going?
X: I'm going to punch Guillermo in his stupid face until he agrees to leave the kingdom.
X: I want to come!
X: Hey, Guillermo! Can you come out here for a... quick meeting?
X: More like a quick beating! Hey-oh!
X: He says "Eat a fat dollop and buzz off!"
X: Blargetha!
X: Finn, you shouldn't break in to a woman's room.
X: Hyah! Everyone okay?
X: Yes. "Tank" you.
X: Huah!
X: Huh?
X: Guillermo! Huh? These are olives.
X: Uh-oh.
X: Blargetha, why would you make a fake husband? You're so hot.
X: You don't know how hard it is to be this hot. Women don't want to talk to you, because they're intimidated, and guys don't want to talk to you, because they're too scared. You're alone in the hottest, most sexiest prison. So I stuck some olives in a glob of gelatin and called it my lover.
X: Well, I'm sorry, Blargetha, but you're going to have to spend more time in your metaphorical prison in a real prison 'cause what you're doing is illegal.
X: Uh, no, it just disqualifies her from challenging me.
X: Whoops.
X: By the authority of Elder Plops, you are still the Slime princess.
X: Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
X: Finn, what do you think?
X: I don't want to disappoint all these people.
X: I'm sorry! I can't do it!

X: Aw, yes. Storm has passed! Jake! Jake...
X: Nachos?
X: Nachos? I love nachos...
X: Hmmm, does that box have a face on it? A face... I gotta make sure.
X: There's a box outside with a face on it! It might be the boxman, it's all soggy and dirty. Want to check it out?
X: Naaaaa... chos.
X: I'm gonna check it out.
X: Yeah, whatever.
X: Hmmm, where'd your face go?
X: Whoa! Okay... shhh... are you lost, little cardboard dude?
X: Jake! There seems to be a lost cat on the ground in a box!
X: Yeah that's great, get it out of here!
X: Hm, gettin' no help from him I guess. Do you know where your home is?
X: Okay, I'll follow you!
[The scene changes to Finn and the box treading through the forest.
X: Whoa, is this your kingdom? It's wonderful!
X: That must be your prince.
X: Huh?
X: Huh... a prince wouldn't steal from his subjects. Awww!
X: Switched? Of course! You must be the real prince, and that thief took your place! Is that right, little prince?
[The scene returns to Jake, who is still playing Pro Football 1861 on BMO.
BMO: Why do you hate cats, Jake?
X: Move your face, you're messing up the game. Anyway, I don't wanna talk about it, it's personal. Cats know what they did...
BMO: Is Jake okay?
X: Eugh... no! I'm pretty dang far from okay! There's a little shard of Tortilla chip caught between my teeth.
X: First, we have to expose the traitor's deception. Ah-hah! That's a counterfeit crown, from the liar's own box flesh. Hmm... it looks like your crown was torn off by some...
X: Mew.
X: Your crown was lost, you say?
X: During a storm? The same storm that sent you hurling through the woods? Until you were delivered into my door step? Right... so it's definitely in the woods somewhere. All we have to do is find your crown to prove to your people that you're the real prince.
X: Um... I'm gonna wait over by the gate, your highness.
BMO: Get big, and the chip will fall out of your teeth!
X: You think I can stretch out of everything? You're so naïve. To live life, you need problems.
BMO: That's stupid!
X: If you get everything you want the minute you want it, then what's the point of livin'?
X: Okay, so let's retrace your steps. Do you remember which path you took? ... Prince?
X: Whoa, you found it already! Good work, team.
X: Ow, quit that! Come, your majesty. It's time...
X: J'accuse!
X: What? They... they don't believe us. The rain made your complexion look all hobo-like. They're not looking past the surface grunk.
X: Oh no, he's challenging you to a joust! I better find you a lance.
BMO: Did it come out?
X: You forgot the most important part, my impatient little friend. A thorough rinsing!
BMO: Well?
X: I need, like, a toothpick, or something.
BMO: I told you to buy floss.
X: Floss is for losers.
X: Oh, one of these will do nicely.
BMO: You'll put cards in your mouth?!
X: Just the edge, kid, then I'll work it like a pro. Now, to find the card that best suits my devil-may-care personality.
X: Trial by combat shall prove which prince's true!
X: The joust's gone nuts!
X: Hey, BMO! Ta-da!
BMO: You did it, Jake! Congratulations! How did you get the piece of tortilla chip out of your teeth?
X: Oh, I didn't. It's still there. It'll be like a constant reminder of what life's all about.
BMO: ... This is unsatisfying!
X: ZIP IT!
X: Bad! Bad princes!
X: Which is which...?
X: Awwww! This is the one! This is your prince!
X: Or maybe this is the one!
X: Hmmm, is this... is this even a kingdom?
X: Haha! Hey! Ow, you guys... aw, come on!


=== S5E39 ===
X: JAKE, WAKE UP! I FOUND A TRUCK!
X: What?
BMO: What's happening?
X: Whoa!
X: I found it in the woods. I named it "Hot Daniel." Anyway, I figured we could do some pretty sick stuff with it.
X: Oh, yeah? Like what?
X: Hmm. I don't know. Launch it off some ramps, maybe get it going thirty miles per hour, crank the wheel into a gnar right-hander, spray dirt everywhere like a big hurkin' dirt wave?
X: Yeah, buddy! Nice! Let's crank this beast up.
X: Can't—engine's busted, I think.
X: Nuts. BMO, you know anything about cars?
BMO: Nope.
X: Hmm. Maybe... Ice King, you know anything about cars?
X: Nope. Not a car guy—too confusing. Got better things to do with my life.
X: Hmm.
X: Wait... I know someone who's good with mechanics.
X: Hey! Hey, guys! Hi!
X: Hey, Banana Man.
X: Wow! I haven't seen you fellas since you destroyed my home, my land, and my rocket.
X: Aw, jeez, yeah. Sorry, Banana Man—just sorta happened.
X: Don't worry about it! Feh! Bygones! I'm just excited you called me over. We're neighbors. We should help each other out. I got the soda and the jams.
X: Cool!
X: I see the problem. The top of your engine is gone, specifically, the cylinder head.
X: Hm. Okay. That word sounds cool... but what does it mean?
X: Let me explain. Think of the cylinder head as an airtight lid to your engine that regulates air, fuel, and exhaust.
X: Okay. Cool. Informative. What is he pointing at?
X: Now this lid is important because it works to get fuel into your engine. You see, your engine has cylinders, and these cylinders are pistons. When the piston in the cylinder moves down, it creates a vacuum, pulling in fuel from the intake.
BMO: You mean an air-fuel mixture?
X: That's right, BMO. Have a gold star, dear.
BMO: Yay! BMO is so pretty and smart!
X: Then the piston returns to the top, compressing the air-fuel mixture. Then a spark plug fires off, creating an explosion, driving the piston back down, powering the engine.
X: Sweet. So where's the cylinder head, then?
X: Hmm. Well, sometimes people store parts they're working on in the car. Found it.
X: Yeah! Drive time!
X: Well... n-not quite. We don't know why they took the cylinder head off. Uh, it could be cracked, the gasket head could be warped, the rod bearings could have damage from water—you see, that's the cool thing about cars. One tiny little thing messes everything else up so nothing works! So it's up to us to figure it out!
X: Cool.
X: Yeah, alright.
X: Whoo. I'm bushed. You guys wanna pick this up again in the mornin'?
X: Sure.
X: Sounds good!
BMO: Not BMO. This grease monkey's torqued up on automotive styles. boyee!
X: Okay, BMO. Good night, Banana Man.
X: Have a good evening, gents.
BMO: Time for the night shift.
X: It's ten past the hour, and this is Graveyard Shift, hosted by me, Starchie the Gravedigger, your weekly five-hour dose of all the strange haints, phantasmagoria, and phenomena I see working in the Candy Kingdom Graveyard. Hello, caller. You're on the Graveyard Shift.
X: What? Am I—oh, hi! Um, longtime listener, first-time caller. So, uh, I think Princess Bubblegum has been replaced by, like, a lizard person.
BMO: A lizard?
X: Yeah, a lizard. I love your show.
X: Oh, Starchie is very interested in this topic. What led you to this discovery, caller?
BMO: They are wrong! You look more like a hippo than a lizard.
X: Well, um, my friend is a very highly-placed official in the Candy Kingdom, and I've noticed—
X: Hi, BMO.
BMO: Stay back, lizard!
X: Sorry, BMO. I-I didn't mean to startle you. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the truck... and biodiesel! Oh, and I figured out what's wrong with the engine block. So what are you working on?
BMO: Aerodynamics.
X: Swe-e-e-et! You know, it's been really nice hanging with you fellas and working on the car. It gets a little lonely at my space-age banana dome.
BMO: You don't have a girlfriend?
X: No. I-I don't want to be alone, but... I've gotten pretty good at it. I putter around the house, keeping busy with my little projects. But it would be nice to find someone.
X: Hold up. Princess? Is that you? Ah, spooky.
X: Yo, BMO. Coffee.
BMO: Thank you.
X: Car looks nice, BMO.
X: Yeah.
X: Uh! Ah! I fixed it! Are we best friends yet?! Oh. Oh, hey. I-I fixed it.
X: N-i-i-i-i-i-ice.
X: I discovered the cylinder head was warped so I went to the junkyard and got a new one. Bingo.
X: Whoo.
X: Biodiesel.
X: Yeah!
X: Awesome!
X: She's beautiful.
X: Well, then go over and talk to her.
BMO: Yeah, come on, Banana Man! You're lonely!
X: Oh, no, that's okay. Having someone to love takes up time I could use to work on stuff.
X: That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Pardon me, miss. My friend here is super smart, and he rebuilt this truck.
BMO: He's very smart and very single!
X: Okay...
X: Anyway, his name is Banana Man. If you like what you see, give him a call.
X: He-e-e-elp m-e-e-e-e-e-e!
X: We gotta save Bubblegum!
BMO: No, Finn! She's a lizard!
X: You gotta stop listening to all those conspiracy shows. They twist up your noodle so you can't tell what's real.
X: Look, there she is!
X: You want some tea?
X: Sure!
X: Thanks, Jake.
X: So, what's up with the angry mob, PB?
X: Oh, they think I've been replaced with an evil lizard replicant. It's sheer nonsense.
BMO: Eat this bug!
X: Punch it, 'Nana Man!
X: What the fridge?
X: Finn, Jake! Reptilian synthoid replicants are trying to take over the kingdom!
X: Yeah. We know.
BMO: Kill it!
X: No, no! I'm the real one!
BMO: Hmm...
X: Hey, speedy. You're comin' with me.
X: What? Really?
X: Mm-hmm... 'cause you ain't got enough peel on that 'nanner! You're under arrest for public indecency!
X: Bye, Banana Man!
BMO: It's not fair!
X: It's okay, BMO. It's a very mild offense.
BMO: It's not like that! Hot Daniel is dead!


=== S5E40 ===
X: Loot, bro!
X: Gear dumped, bro! How about this room, bro?
X: Looks like a brolicious room to relax in and play video games... bro.
X: Home, sweet home, bro.
X: Yeah, you said it. I've been home this whole time.
X: I keep forgetting that he lives here now.
X: Just until Gunter finishes rebuilding the Ice Kingdom.
X: What y'all whisperin' about?
X: this couch ain't for cuddlin'.
X: Sure it is.
X: It isn't!
X: Mm, it's cozy.
X: It's not that bad, Jake.
X: See?
X: Finn, can I speak to you in the kitchen?
X: Oh, hey, Jake, can you bring me a sandwich? Sandwich?
X: It's time to kick Ice King out!!
X: Don't forget the bread! Haha!
X: Look, I hear you. But we can't kick him out because I still feel guilty about junking up his crib. Hey, what if we check him into a hotel room?
X: Hmmm?
X: What's that?
X: Checking him to a hotel room.
X: Oooh! Sandwich time!
X: Hey, Simon, how would you like to stay in the Coolest Hotel?
X: Lumpy Space Princess stays there. That's how cool it is.
X: We'll even put you up for few weeks until your place is ready.
X: Ahh, but that sounds lonely. I just like to stay here with you guys! Having roommates is nice! It keeps me out of my head. Gunther says only "Wenk!" What's up with that?
X: Hehe, yeah?
X: Finn, I'm ready to murder the Ice King.
X: No. I-I have another idea.
X: Oop.
X: Oh, my gosh! Someone's at the door. We have a doorbell now. We'll get it.
X: Abracadaniel?!
X: What are you doing here?
X: What? You kept calling and call...
X: Hahaha! Shut up-up-up-up-up, Abracadeez!
X: Yeah, man! You don't even need a reason to stop by!
X: A sexy wizard like you goes where he wants!
X: Whoa-oh! I see what's going on!
X: What... You do?
X: Yeah! This wizard donk
X: Dang! But you're funny, Abracadaniel!
X: I didn't say anything.
X: Fantastic.
X: Hey, Abadabs!
X: Oh? Uhh. Yeah! I suppose I could!
X: So good! Whoo!
X: You're a good wizard!
X: I don't know, it's dumb! I'm still working on it! It's-It's nothing!
X: Oh, you're right that ain't nothing! Check out this wizar! What?
X: Ohh! You're the greatest wizard ever!
X: Well, maybe not ever ever! Am I the greatest wizard in our generation? Yes.
X: This was a great idea, man! It's like he's forgotten all about us!
X: Uhh-huh. Pretty soon, he'll be outta here for good.
X: For good!
X: Yeah!
X: Ice King? What's up? Huh? What the flip?
X: Tada!
X: How'd they get the other couch down here?
X: There you are, sir. There you are. Right this way.
BMO: You made it!
X: Caw! Tada!
BMO: A bird! He's a bird!
X: I've always been into interpretive dance. But I've never been able to find a musician who could match my energy until now!
X: Huh! He's actually not bad!
X: No!
BMO: Awww!
X: No!
BMO: Ow! No!
X: Ow! Why are you doing this?!
BMO: You pushed my whole body!
X: Um, whoo! That was great, guys!
X: Yeah? You guys liked it?
X: Well, then the second and third acts are gonna knock your socks off!
X: Uh, actually, Jake and I have got, uh, got some stuff to take care of.
X: Yeah... It's getting pretty late.
X: Uh... oh, Glob.
X: 'Sup, ABD?
X: I just remember that I'm, uh, a-allergic, uh, to, to the night sky.
X: You're afraid of the dark?
X: Yes, if I ever had to walk, uh, outside at night, I might die of-of...
X: Of fright.
X: Of fright!
X: Gee. Well, I guess you can crash here for the night.
X: All right!
X: Sleepover!!
X: Wait! Are you really afraid of the dark?
X: Maybe.
X: Okay. Well, you can sleep on the couch. We're gonna go. Uh, good night.
X: Whoa!
X: See, I told you! Isn't it awesome? Eh, since I'm pretty much in charge here, we can totally take all this treasure if we wanted to.
X: Ha! Totally!
X: Wow! Cool!
X: Oh, that's just a byncomire.
X: Ohh!
X: Wanna see something really cool?
X: Yeah!
X: Okay, but you gotta promise not to freak out!
X: This is Joshua the Dog's Demon Blood Sword.
X: Yeah! It's a real demon blood sword.
X: What?!
X: And you see these words? If you say them out loud, you can actually see a vision of the demon whose blood was used to make the sword!
X: No way! That sounds awesome! Too bad neither of us can read Demon Runes.
X: Ooh! I know how! Butyrum lac surepo kee oth pradium, like that!
X: Oops.
X: Wow! It looks so real!
X: I am real!
X: Bring me the true bearer of my blood sword or I will destroy you both!
X: Come on, best friend, let us not betray Finn! Let's fight Kee-Oth ourselves!
X: Nobody can defeat us if we work together! Super Wizard Team Up!
X: You're wasting your powers on me. Haha!
X: Oh! No! Oh, no! He's too powerful!
X: Kee-Oth!
X: Joshua!
X: Kee Oth Rama Pancake...
X: Don't say another word, Joshua! Or the throats are going to get it! If you speak the words to banish me, I'll reduce your friends to ash!
X: Kee Oth Rama P...
X: Dude!!
X: I thought he was bluffing.
X: I'm not bluffing, Joshua! If you do not willingly return my stolen blood, I will destroy him
X: Ahh! The sword!
X: Scary!
X: I just can't do it, Jake. This is Dad's sword!
X: You don't have any other choice! Do it!
X: Do it!!
["Do it!!" echoes. Finn breaks the sword using his knee. The sword breaks in half. The bloods rise up.
X: Whoa.
X: You got your blood, now get outta here!
X: Uh, hey, so, uh, I should be getting home.
X: Uh, yeah, me, too. Hey, Abracadaniel, wanna hang out at my place?
X: I thought your house broke.
X: Ice Kingdom's been rebuilt for weeks!
X: Jake?


=== S5E41 ===
X: Your butt is mine, Joshua.
X: What? My butt? Weird. Where are we?
X: This is my yoga room. And this is your new home. Downward, dog!
X: Ouch!
X: Welcome to revenge, Joshua. You'll never see your loved ones again. Everything you need for survival is booby-trapped!
X: Hmm.
X: Now I'm gonna gank your blood the way you ganked mine.
X: Boo-yeah! How does it feel, dog? How does it feel that I've juiced your body and turned your blood into man dazzle?
X: Hmm. Not that great. I feel weird in my skin.
X: Wait. Is that it?
X: Yeah... but I could get used to this.
X: What? No! You have to suffer.
X: Okay.
X: No "okay." When I say something, you're supposed to disagree! Okay?
X: Okay.
X: Sheesh. You're causing tension in my neck and shoulders. I'm gonna go stretch it out. You stay here and suffer.
X: Okay.
X: Jake?
X: 여보세요? (Hello?)
X: Hey, Lady. Listen. Your husband got abducted by Kee-Oth the demon.
X: 누구? Jake? (Who are you talking about? Jake?)
X: Yeah, your hubby - your boyfriend or whatever.
X: 어머, 뭔 소리야! 걔 내 남자친구잖아! 왜 자꾸 우리 사이를 이상한 쪽으로 몰고 가려고 그래? (Oh, what are you talking about! He's my boyfriend! Why are you keep assuming my relationship between Jake weirdly!)
X: Yo, my Korean is not that good. Can you just get over here? We need to find a way to Kee-Oth's dimension 십시요..
X: 아! 맞아. 내가 도움 될 만한 거 가지고 있어! (Oh, right! I got something that can be helpful!)
X: Alright. That sounds...affirmative. See you soon. Bye.
X: Excuse me?
X: Hmm?
X: Down here. Hi!
X: Oh my fun. I thought you was a rock.
X: I'm not a rock. I'm a Little Buddy. Can you get off me, please?
X: Whoops! Sorry.
X: It's okay.
X: Cool. You wanna be friends?
X: I'd like that. I've never had a friend.
X: Whoa. Seriously?
X: My species spends its first twelve years sleeping. I just woke up today!
X: Whoop! She's here.
BMO: I thought my body was hopping up and down. But I was sitting still.
X: 가지고 왔어! (I've got it!)
X: What is it, Lady?
X: 옛날에 조슈아가 만든 테잎이야. 제이크가 그 위에 그냥 녹음해버려서 기억하고 있어. 그 앞쪽은 보지 말고 그냥 빨리 돌려! (It's a video tape that was made by Joshua long ago. I remembered it because Jake recorded something else on top of it. Just skip past the front section!)
X: What?
X: 앞쪽 보지 말고 그냥 빨리 달.. 돌리라구. (Just skip the front section of the tape.)
X: Eh, something skip? I don't know. Just play it, BMO.
X: Jake? Finn? Jermaine? Whoever is watching this?
X: Dad!
X: I just opened up an unexplored cavern deep in the underground grasslands complex. Please refer to my chart system, okay? I'm in cave 73H. In case I am overtaken by an enemy I need you to retrieve my corpse.
X: Hey, Lady. You asked me to make you a video.
X: 돌려! 돌려!! (Skip!! Skip!!!)
X: BMO! Skip! Skip!!
X: ...saying JTD won't change his doggy ways.
X: That should be good.
X: Kee-Oth zaple myrups pama...
X: Okay, this is scene one and take one of Heat Signature 2. Ready? Action!
BMO: Father, it has been a year since I was on the submarine, but, I still hear the screams! I was forced to choose; the lives of my men, or the entire planet! What would you do? Tell me father! I'm a mess, man!
X: Wait, what do I say? Mmmm, Check please-
X: No!
X: Hold on, BMO, I feel like we should watch more of this video for clues, but you gotta promise me that I'm not going to see more weird Jake stuff.
X: 더이상 제이크가 이상한 짓 하는 거 없을 거야. 진짜야! 그래도 내가 이 테잎 본 지 하도 오래 돼서 장담은 못 하겠네. 미안해. (I don't think there's any more weird Jake stuff. Really! But I can't promise anything, as I haven't seen this tape for years! Sorry for that.)
X: Okay, high-five! Play it, BMO!
X: Hmm, guess what, Lady? This dirty dog needs a bath!
X: Wawoo!
X: This stinks!
X: What'a mean?
X: Come on, Joshua! Back in the old days, you would have been up here trying to take me apart!
X: Uh, what? That's my dad, Joshua, back in the old days.
X: I'm his son, dude.
X: Shoot.
X: Where is he?
X: He's dead, dude. Don't make me get emotional about it.
X: Then why you being such a wimp then? Come on up here and beat on me like your dad would.
X: Okay, that's weird.
X: What's weird?
X: You want to get beat up? That's weird. I'm not doin' your weird biz.
X: You won't fight?!
X: Nope.
X: What the—!
X: Hi. I'm Samantha.
X: I'm Jay T.—the Dog. I'm Jake.
X: Only one can survive my pit! This bozo tried stealing my blood too! So youse better duke it out, and see who gets to live!
X: But I haven't seen a man-dog in years! And now the universe has dropped one into my arms!
X: Whoa, lady, no way. This boy's got.
X: But fate has brought us together! The stars have paired you with a goddess.
X: I like the way you talk, but you are crazy.
X: Kill or be killed, you two!
X: Yes, if I'm so crazy, then let's fight!
X: No, girl, we can bounce outta here. My friend Finn will save us any second now.
X: I don't wait for rescue. I conquer till I am conquered. By love... or by the hand of an adversary.
X: Well, I guess we're gonna have to fight then.
X: Okay, take your time. I gotta do my daily sun salutation.
X: I'll show you!
[Kee-Oth starts to suck Joshua's blood, but starts gagging.
X: Dude, your blood is harsh!
X: That's because I've been drinking so much holy water. It's in my blood, sucka! And naturally, I gotta go to the bathroom like crazy. Be right back!
X: If I can't suck you, I'll suck myself's blood.
X: Hehehe...Taste it, scrub! AUGH!
X: Man, I can't believe it...I gotta wee-wee again!
X: Would you like to rate this video?
X: No time, Beemo. Let's go find the cave from the video. Maybe we'll find more clues there.
X: 잠깐! 내가 네 주위에 보호막 쳐야 돼! (Wait! I must cast a protective shield around you!)
X: 됐다. 이제 가도 돼. (Done, now you're good to go.)
X: Kee Oth Zaple Myrups Rama Mancakes?
X: Whoa.
X: Jake? Yeesh.
X: Eh?
X: Jake?
X: Finn, yes! Help me!
X: Jake! 왜 저 못생긴 지지배가 널 껴안고 있는거야! (Jake! Why is that ugly chick hugging you!)
X: This isn't hugging—it's fighting! Fighting!
X: Jake, what do I do? Should I kill him?
X: With what?
X: With this!
X: Demon blood...
X: That's right! Demon blood beats demon!
X: No, that is not correct!
X: Hahahaha! Oh yeah! Gimme that blood, stupid!
X: Lady! Don't break the circle of protection!
X: 당연하지! (Of course I won't!)
X: Aw geez, he's sucking my sword off its hilt!
X: Yeah, hahaha! Your circle can't stop my sucking! Now I have your demon blood as well!
X: Except it's not demon blood! It's a frozen grape juice that was blessed by the priest.
X: Bless this sword, fodder.
X: Mmm, check please!
X: Mmm, grape-y!
X: Wait... Aaaaaah!
X: My blood! Woo!
X: Coward!
X: Woop! Hey, hey! Lady!
X: Let's go, bros!
X: Samantha, you can come too, I guess.
X: Very well.
X: You've returned me to my world, so I recant my oath to destroy you.
X: You made an oath. Okay.
X: Let's fight again some time.
X: Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree.
X: Hmm. Took you long enough to stretch outta that pit.
X: 뭐, 뭐가 어떻게 된 거야? 너 저 여자한테 반한 거야 뭐야! (What is happening? Did you fall in love with that lady or what!)
X: Pshh, please! Not even.
X: 그럼 그 함정에서 왜 그렇게 오래 버티고 있었어? (Then why did you spend that long time in the pit?)
X: Uh, because... Kee-Oth was right there! An-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it.
X: Jake!
X: Woo...Sorry, I got a little light-headed.
X: 아, 이 말썽꾸러기. 사랑해 자기야. (Ah, you little troublemaker, I love you, honey.)
X: I love you too, Lady.
X: Yo, guys, I still love Flame Princess.
X: Okay, big hug!
X: Hug!


=== S5E44 ===
X: Cinnamon Bun, what the heck are you doing out in the woods?! I asked you twenty minutes ago to take these drinks around for us.
X: Oh, oh, "around for us." I thought you said "walk to the zoo and back"!
X: Gob.
X: Finn, Cinnamon Bun's gonna attend your juice bar now. I have a special job for you.
X: As Ooo's greatest champion, I'm relying on you to keep Lumpy Space Princess from crashing this wedding. I went ahead and deputized you. So, you know, no holds barred, got it?
X: Yeah. Oh, what about Jake?
X: Well, honestly I haven't seen Jake this happy in a while.
X: I kinda don't want squash his groove.
X: Knock, knock. Hey, Tree Trunks.
X: Oh, hey, Princess. Wow, you look prettier than a sippy cup in a snowbank.
X: Thanks, Tree Trunks. Now listen, I don't want you to worry about a thing. I've got Finn on LSP Deputy, and we're keeping your ex-husbands, Randy, Danny and Wyatt, a hundred feet apart at all times - at least until it's time for me to perform the ceremony.
X: Oh, well, uh, Princess, I appreciate your generosity going to all this trouble to hijack my wedding and all, but you can't perform the ceremony.
X: What?! Why not?
X: Uh, well, I'm sorry, but I just don't recognize your quote unquote "authority" on such matters. I can only be married by His Holiness, the One True King of Ooo.
X: WHAT? That fraud?!
X: Now I know...
X: That fraud is here?!
X: Why, yes, but...
X: Oh, dear. Mama, I'm afraid I've offended the Princess.
X: I'd like to open up that hood, see how the bologna gets made!
X: Mama, please! Please don't call him a saucy fine bologna factory!
X: Bologna factory, bologna factory, bologna factory!
X: Oh, my perfect day. What else could go wrong?
X: Please, go on. Describe the next thought form.
X: Um... I see, like, reddish-green blotches.
X: Ah... Ahaha! One year good luck.
X: I've waited a long time for this King of Ooo, and now I'm gonna expose you in front of everyone for what you really are!
BMO: Yay!

X: Sure!

BMO: I am the best! I love weddings, I love flowers! I love LOVE!
X: Hey, did you know I used to be married to Tree Trunks?
BMO: No!
X: Heh, yeah... it's just me and TT. We had some wild times back in the day. Did you know I once taught her to play tennis?
BMO: No...
X: Yep, tennis! I took her to one of those... uh... paddles... or whatever, you know!
BMO: No.
X: Yeah, she left me. She said I was stifling her spirit... I mean hehe... You know, what? Not enough tennis for ya?
BMO: No.
X: It's starting! The ceremony is starting!
X: No! Uh, please stay here! This is cathartic. You're a good listener.
X: Psst, Sweetie, you look so nice.
X: Shh...
X: Sounds really sweet.
X: Lumpy Space Princess? Is that you?
X: Let me go to this party...
X: It's not your party, LSP.
X: Poor Finn. Don't you know? Every party is my party.
X: I'm just gonna look in this guy's blimp. with the laws.
X: Psst... sweetie, what are ya doing?
X: Get out of my way, Finn. Oh my glob, you're touching my woman body!
X: Okay, dear, now up you come.
X: There you go!
X: Whoa, whoa, kids! Gotta finish the ceremony first. Keep the baby in the basket!
X: Everyone at the party get ready! 'Cause here comes the hot bunch of grapes!
X: Ahhhh... oh my gaaaah...
X: We've gathered here on this beautiful day, under my life-giving sun, to celebrate the enjoinment of Mr. Pig and Tree Trunks, the little elephant. These two weird animals...
BMO: I bet some cute weddings are happening over there.
X: BMO, you're so nice.
BMO: Those flowers look really cold.
X: I've had a hard life. People seem cute. They seem nice. And then when you can't stop crying because they beat you in tennis that one time, they call you a baby.
BMO: Yeah, cute nice babies.
X: BMO?
BMO: Mm-hmm?
X: BMO, would you move in with me?
X: Do you, Mr Pig, take Tree Trunks to be your ever-wedded wife, forever following the teachings of me the true King of Ooo?
X: I do.
X: Do you, Tree Trunks, do you promise to love Mr. Pig forever, and spend the next 5 years with me and my serenity compound, performing simple household repairs, to have and to hold the in sickness and in health, in my gated mountain compound?
X: I...
X: Everybody get ready... to pay attention to me...
X: I...
X: do... oh
X: Everybody, hey! I'm here! Look at my bouq-
X: Ah...
X: My zep!
X: Everybody! This wedding is a farce! A criminal farce!
X: Hey, just what are you egging at here?
X: I'll tell you what I'm egging at! I'm egging at this outdated wedding officiant license!
X: Oh, is that what this is about? You must've found that in my back records! I have the up-to-date paperwork right here!
X: Oh!
X: What? Uh...
X: Hey, wait, how did you get that? I could've swore it was locked in my zep.
X: No... shhh... no... nope nope, stop talking, go to jail! Yeah!
X: Princess Bubblegum, you have gone too far. We stand together against your tyranny.
X: Hey, everybody.
X: Your prison may hold one of us, but it may not hold all of us.
X: Oh, poor Tree Trunks. Wait, where's my mama? Has anyone seen my... oh!
X: No, Mama. Well I guess this is it, sweetie. Oh, oh no, the elephant graveyard is calling me now. Okay, hold your horses, I'm coming!
X: everyone we care about is all here together. Finn, Uncle Donald, Banana Guard Number 1, Jake, Jake Junior, everybody. We can have the ceremony right here.
X: Hey yeah! King of Ooo, will you do the honors?
X: Are you crazy? That loopy bird is gonna string me up sideways. You can perform your own dang ceremony. Kingofooo.com!
X: Oh, dear.
X: Oh, my gosh. Tree Trunks, did you hear?
X: Huh?
X: The King said you can perform your own dang ceremony!
X: Yeah, that really stunk.
X: But...
X: But... the King's word is law. I can perform my own dang ceremony?
X: Are you up to it, TT?
X: I'll try. I guess it's time. A-are you ready?
X: Oh. Okay, um... do you Mr Pig take me, Tree Trunks, to be your beautiful wedded wife?
X: I do.
X: And do I, Mr Pig, take him to be your lawful wedded husband, Tree Trunks?
X: I do.
X: Then you... you may kiss the bride!
X: Aww, geez, let them all go, Banana Guard Number 3.
X: Uh... what?
X: I just can't stay mad at something so cute.
X: Did she just say let everyone go?
X: Looks like we got the whole place to ourselves... if you know what I'm saying.
X: Wait, d-don't you think there might be cameras down here?
X: I hope so...


=== S6E4 ===
X: Okay, now easy does it.
X: Ohh!
X: Thanks a lot, Dad!
X: Finn? Finn, what happened?
X: I... messed up the spaghetti, and then I got mad, and PB's candy arm exploded.
X: Man, I knew that arm was bogus.
X: Yeah, it wasn't the greatest. Sorry about the spaghetti, though.
X: Man, don't worry about that. You just went through some outrageous beeswax from losing your favorite arm and et cetera. You can't just expect to bounce right back to normal.
X: I can't?
X: Nah, man. Listen. that's where the real instructions are.
X: My melon wants to punch my dad in the face and steal his arm.
X: She's powerful. You must've exploded the candy arm before and made the rock pile just know. It's almost like I'm trying to tell myself something, like a message from my melon heart.
X: Jake, Jake! Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
X: Afternoon Princess. What's that you're building?
X: Wait, you don't know?
X: I might.
X: Here, look. It was taped to the tower.
X: Wow, what the he?
X: My biggest powerometer back at the castle was flipping all the way out. It looks like Finn somehow manifested a telekinetic electro-emotional prosthesis.
X: Word. Word.
X: With this much raw power he could be a danger to himself or others. So I've quarantined the area till I can coax him down.
X: Pfft. TMLO Princess.
X: What does that mean?
X: That means lay off. Finn's feeling this one out solo style. Give the kid a chance.
X: Baby's building a tower into space. Space is where he's gonna find his dad. Daddy's got an arm, and baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad.
X: Ahh!
X: Oh, hi.
X: Get out of my house or I'm going to face blaaaast you.
X: Hi.
X: Waah.
X: Yep, yeah. I know you. You're one of those swimmers right? A reeeal swim nut.
X: What? No, I'm Finn.
X: Well you can't swim in me. Not anymore, I'm not water. You can't get me up your nooooose.
X: Okay, I'm going to keep going.
X: I'm going to keep going, into here.
X: Oh, baby's a tower into space. Space where he's gonna find his dad.
X: Goodnight buddy, I'm proud of you.
X: From like where that round of the arm bone meets that weird flat bone on the top of the back. Gonna pull that until it comes off. Baby's building a tower of revenge...
X: Hey kid. It's me again. Carroll, my name's Carroll.
X: Finn.
X: Finn, look I'm sorry about blasting you yesterday. Hey man, are you really gonna do those things?
X: Uh, yeah, for revenge. I think it'll feel good.
X: I get it, I get it. But let me tell you something. I used to be water. Like a pond or something real wet. I used to hate people swimming in me, kicking and stuff. So what did I do? I evaporated, I got myself out of there.
X: You should have pulled off their legs.
X: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, you have to stop obsessing about revenge. You gotta really dwell on it. Ah!
X: What was that?
X: I just thought about my anxieties and it's like my mind hand touched a hot memory stove.
X: Hmm.
X: Ah!
X: Interesting. Oh hey, what are your thoughts on melon hearts?
X: I don't know what you're talking about. Alright then, I guess I'll see you later.
BMO: Hey Jake, where's... Where's Finn?
X: Finn's just working some stuff out, AND IT'S HEALTHY!
X: It's not healthy, it's bizarre and he could get hurt!
X: Feelings hurt!
X: Eeeeah.
X: Eeeeeeeeeah.
BMO: Eeah.
X: I figured I could turn into spaces, or something.
X: Hey, hey dad?
X: Huh? Oh good, you're awake.
X: Give, give it. Give me the... give me give it. Give me the...
X: Oh, my favorite arm.
X: Butts. Butts.
X: Didn't help much did it.
X: No. Wait, what?
X: Bong Bong. Sorry buddy.
X: PB? Wait, where am I?
X: We're in the Candy Kingdom fallout shelter. I brought you here after you passed out on the tower. You were hallucinating like crazy so it was really easy to trick you. I figured you'd thank me later after learning your lesson.
X: Right, right.
X: And look, the arm is gone too. See? So what do you think?
X: Hmm. Yeah, okay. Thanks Princess.
X: Oh, hey buddy you're back. How are you feeling?
X: Um, neutral I guess. I don't want to punch my dad anymore.
X: Ha, Ha! That's great! So I guess we won't be needing this thing anymore. You wanna do the honors?
X: Yes I do.
X: MY ARM!!!


=== S6E5 ===
X: BMO, when is something going to happen?
BMO: Shh. Just watch. It happens once a month—I promise.
BMO: This is it!
X: Oooooh.
X: But where does it go?
BMO: That's none of our business.
X: Tickets! Get your tickets here! See the world's greatest tiny circus! Witness the amazing wood-eating termite! The mighty strong-ant!
X: You're late, Blue Nose! Get into makeup!
X: You stink!
X: Heh-heh, wasn't that something? Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, you're perfectly safe. But at this time, I'd like to ask anyone with a medical condition to please leave the premises at once. What you're about to witness with your own eyes may shock and astound you to your very core.
X: Tonight, I give you the wildest, most dangerous beast anywhere in captivity! The horrible, the stupendous... Goralina!
X: Attagirl!
X: Don't worry, Junior. It's all part of the act.
X: Blue Nose! Boy, am I glad to see you. Come in, come in! Sit down. You did good out there tonight with the belly-dancing routine. Real good. Aw, don't give me that look. I know we said we were going to let the chipmunk go at the end of last season, but Goralina is our big draw. You understand that.
X: three whole pennies. Think you can make me this kind of cash? You do that, I won't need the chipmunk anymore. I'll let her go, just like I promised. But you're gonna have to lose the fancy-schmancy stuff and give the people what they want! Get it?!
X: The old Blue Nose magic.
X: Aren't you glad we came back for the second show?
X: Oho! You were great, kid! That's what I'm talking about. With you and the chipmunk in the show, we're gonna have a real one-two punch!
X: Hey... I know what I said, but I want to see how many boxcars this gravy train has on it.
X: Look at her. It's like looking at a big, sad dollar sign.
X: Yipe!
X: Whoa-ho!
X: Oh!
X: That's right. Lift with your legs first, then put your back into it.
X: There he is. Gotcha! Thought you could skip out, eh? and start your own circus!
X: Yeah, you! You and your corny clown hat!
X: Hey, he's smiling!
X: What's so funny?
X: You rat!
X: You creep! What's the big joke?
X: Ha ha! Neat!


=== S6E8 ===
X: Ah.
BMO: Stand and deliver, boy, because I'm Robbing Hood. Give me all your funny money, Sheriff of Naughty-hams.
X: But BMO, I don't want to be the bad guy. I want to be Robbing Hood's pal, Friar Tux.
BMO: No, Neptr.
X: No fair. En guard!
BMO: On Blitzen!
BMO: You're terrible!
BMO: Whoa!
BMO: Eeeee!
X: Aaaaa!
X: What? Hey! What are you kids doing breaking the treehouse?
BMO: Uh...
X: Yo, BMO, what happened?
BMO: You got too much money, honey. All of this dosh is threatening the structural integrity of the treehouse.
X: Who would have thought we could have too much treasure?
X: I'm sorry, master.
X: Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant!
X: You told me to stay inside the money room, but now I am outside. What is your punishment, master?
X: No punishment, dude. Just chill where you are.
X: All right. I will chill where I am until you command me.
X: So what should we do with all this swash?
BMO: You should give it to Robbing Hood.
X: No way, BMO. This is our treasure.
BMO: Aw.
X: Hey, maybe we could, like, spend it?
X: Really? How much of it?
X: Dude, like all of it. Then we can find completely new treasure.
X: Neptr knows just the place to blow your grease. Behold, this recent advertisement.
X: Whoa! We get mail?
X: Check it out, Jake.
X: Dang! Wildberry Kingdom got all fancy.
X: I continue to chill.
BMO: Come on, Naughty-Hams.
X: Thank you.
X: Nice place. So how are we gonna spend all this gish?
X: I don't know. I've never really spent money before. I've only stolen it or hoarded it.
X: Ha!
X: So... here we are in the middle of town.
X: Let's parse out some dough to spend.
X: Hey! What are you doing? No people or money allowed in the fountain, ya dums! Where's your sense at?!
X: Sorry, man. We were just looking to spend some cash in town. Want some?
X: Fellas, goofing in a public fountain is punishable by a lashing, and you're trying to bribe me.
X: Ooh! Now that's what I'm talking about, fellas. Have a good time in the fountain.
X: Whoa. Spending money is kind of fun.
X: Yeah, this'll be easy. Ho, ho, young berry lads!
X: Yeah?
X: Go buy the most expensive meats and furniture to adorn our new fountain home. Keep the change for your families in need. Hyup!
X: Thanks, but we're, uh, middle-class.
X: Really?
X: Uh, yeah, upper middle.
X: Just get the darn furniture.
X: Hey, no furniture or meat in the fountain! You'll wreck up the water!
X: You can't buy me off twice, fellas.
X: Dude, we bought all this furniture and meat, and we still have a ton of gamboni left.
X: Hmm. Look at those gams! Hey, yo, Legs! Legs! You want a bag of money?
X: Sure!
X: Well, what are you gonna do for it?
X: Well, um, I'm a dancer by trade.
X: Show me.
X: Hup!
X: Finn, look. I made this guy dance.
X: Yeah, man. Whoo!
X: Hold it! No dancing in the streets without a permit!
X: Go away, dude.
X: Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
X: All right, I'm going!
X: This is crazy. People do anything for money. And I've got a ton of money. Dance harder, Legs! Harder!
X: Okay.
X: Ahem.
X: Mabel, do you hear something?
X: Good evening.
X: Oh no! We're being robbed!
X: Oh, no, we're not robbers. We're actually here to give you money.
X: What?
X: Listen. I want to see you two do things for this bag of money.
X: Okay, man.
X: Yeah, nice. Goji Berry Man, you sleep on the left side of the bed normally. Now you sleep on the right!
X: Okay.
X: I don't like sleeping on your side. It's too close to the wall!
X: Mr. Goji Berry, you sleep on your back now—and on top of the covers.
X: I can't sleep on my back, man. I got sleep apnea. I won't get any sleep. My wife won't get any sleep. My dance instructing will suffer.
X: Turning down all this smoosh, huh? Dance instruction pays more than I thought.
X: Wait, man! There's got to be something else we can do to get those gold coins.
X: Well, sure, man. As a matter of fact, you can have all the gold coins... all the gold coins you can eat!
X: Dinner is served!
X: Guys, I'm super sorry about my friend. Here.
X: Don't eat it, ya dums!
X: How much do you think I'd have to pay them to lick the dust off all this dusty stuff?
X: Dude, I do not approve of the way you're spending money right now.
X: Dude, they're not doing anything they don't want to. They want my sweet cheddar, and I want to see some stuff in exchange. It's mutual—free market.
X: What?
X: Free market!
X: Don't worry, brother. I'll help you see the error of your ways.
X: Berry lads! Berry lads! I need to spend all this blingo fast.
X: Okay.
X: Take me to the seediest alley in the kingdom.
X: That's Crudberry Back Alley... in Crud Town.
X: Friendly Crudberries, I have money for you! Come get it!
X: Money? Money!
X: Easy, fellas! Let's pass these out one at a time.
X: Hey, take it easy, breh.
X: Give us that money!
X: I-I-I don't want any trouble. I'm trying to help you.
X: How much coin would it take for you to be my berry foot warmer?
X: Dude!
X: Oh, hey, man.
X: Jake, this money is bad. We got to get rid of all of it right now.
X: Okay, I got a plan. And this time, it's gonna involve all the money.
X: Finn and Jake?
X: Princess, are you ready to earn all this cay-ash?
X: What...?
X: All of this sweet, sweet crunkle is yours if you let me... sit on your head.
X: Get out of here!
X: No one can say no to this much dinero. ♪M-m-money♪
X: Jake, I am warning you.
X: ♪M-m-money♪
X: ♪M-m-money♪
X: Aah! Guards! Guards! Seize Finn and Jake and prepare them for execution!
X: Or don't do that and get paid mad bucks.
X: And take all their money!
X: Take all my money?!
X: Well, we were trying to get rid of all that skrilla anyway, right?
X: Finn and Jake, yes, you have insulted me, but worse than that, you have abused the power of money!
X: We will deal with you swiftly and ironically by encasing you in your own molten gold!
X: Release the golden flood!
X: Oh, no! Aah!
X: Who dares?
BMO: Ho, ho, ho! Robbing Hood is the defender of the poor!
X: Me too!
X: Good shot, BMO!
BMO: I was aiming for the rope. Yeah!
X: Let's bounce, po' boy.
X: Finn and Jake, if you ever return to Wildberry Kingdom again, I'll have you double-dipped in gold! Unless I get a written apology.
X: Huh? Gold piece. You want to flip to see who writes that apology letter?
X: How about you write it, I sign it.
X: No way, man.


=== S6E16 ===
X: Birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday! Yeah! Yay!
X: Nice job, Mr. Birthday Boy.
X: Thanks.
X: Man, you are like another year older, but you look good. Like, super good.
X: Yup. Mom and dad passed down some pretty good genes.
X: Oh yeah, mom and dad. Hey, did mom and dad tell you any stories about when you were born?
BMO: Yay! Birthday story time, please.
X: There, there, baby. You're going to be a fighter.
X: Steak break.
X: Let's get started.
X: These steaks are tough and stringy. Like you.
X: Oh, good one, dear. Hey, after dinner, what do you say we check the ticker-type for new cases?
X: Margaret, you're in a family way now. You should take a backseat from investigations.
X: Oh, come on, Joshua. Even with this ankle-biter, I'm as quick as ever. Sure, my waist is bigger, but that just means more bullets in my ammo belt.
X: You're missing the point, sugar. What if something bad happens? Let's say we're out on the beat, fighting some lowlife. He takes a punch, you zig when you should've zagged, and oops! Junior takes a knock to the noodle, comes out with the shiner the size of a grapefruit. I can't take that kind of guilt and neither can you.
X: I can take care of myself just fine. And besides, these babies
X: Yeah, you got me there.
X: Now let's get over to that ticker-type and look for some perps.
X: You relax, dear, I got it. Hmm. Let's get a look here. "Vampire girl spotted in the Grass Lands harassing sheep and cattle." Nope, nope, nope. "Small fire goblin burns down Candy Kingdom forest."
X: Hey, that sounds fun. Let's do that.
X: Wait, wait, here's one. " Woman's pies go missing in Bucolic Countryside where nothing ever happens." The perfect case for my pregnant wife!
X: What?
X: Now let's get an egg in our shoe and beat it.
X: Yes? Hello?
X: our boy. We're responding to a wire about missing pies.
X: Oh, yes. A-a-a monster's been stealing my pies off of the windowsill.
X: A monster, eh?
X: Oh, yes, you can see the monster tracks leading off into the forest.
X: Well, those tracks are as phony as a three dollar bill.
X: The monster tracks are very real. Wyatt!
X: Aw, aw geez. You got me.
X: What's the big idea, Wyatt? Why'd you burgle your wife's pie?
X: Because it's amazing! Oh, I can't get enough of it.
X: You could just ask for seconds.
X: But I want thirds and fourths! I want to stop when I want to stop!
X: Oh, Wyatt.
X: Oh, it's the only good part of my day.
X: Well, there you have it. The only monster here was this man's appetite for his wife's pie.
X: Oh, no. But the monster is real. He snuck up and rubbed my elbow while I was gardening. And Leftenant Candy Corn said it came in through the window and touched him on the chest. Oh! Oh, now I got myself all scared. W-won't you check around to make sure no one is out there?
X: Of course. Probably nothing more than a peeper. Ha! These country yokels are all just superstitious. I bet you that old elephant sees a monster a day.
X: Joshua, look! Something way larger than Wyatt made them. These tracks look real.
X: Hot cram! A peeping monster! Oh, this town would surely put up a collection to nab this guy. Oh, too bad you're preggo. We got to pass.
X: Come on, Joshua!
X: What?
X: Ha ha!
X: Margaret! Margaret! Wait for Pappy!
X: Hmm. The tracks end here.
X: I'll show that peepsie the pepper!
X: Gads! Do your worst, you masher.
X: Joshua! Baby cakes! Oh, this is all my fault!
X: Uh, yeah, pretty much.
X: Ah, good last meal. Okay, well, I got bit by a monster, a creature of the night. We both know what comes next for me. Just make it snappy, darling.
X: Oh! Puddin' Pie!
X: I'm fine. Just got to pop out and fetch that venom.
X: You're about as fine as a canary in a cat mine!
X: Come in, Margaret. Do you read me? Over.
X: You have to say "over" or I think you're still talking. Over.
X: And what's with all this baby paraphernalia? Wait a tick. Are you a baby?
X: Uh-huh.
X: Oh, no! I must've scared the dickens out of you!
X: Margaret, stay away. Something's about to happen!
X: Margaret!
X: Boy, Jake left a scar on my head the size of a nickel. I'll have to wear a hat now, Margaret.
X: Of course we do, dear. He's our boy.
X: That he is.
X: Yes, we've got one boy that I gave birth to and one boy that you gave birth to. Let's never tell him how it happened.
X: Agreed.
X: And so they never told me.
X: Never told you what?
X: I don't know. They never told me. Ha!

X: I know, but I got a headache, and I'm in a funky mood.
X: What's wrong, dude?
X: I don't know. I think I got restless leg syndrome.
X: Is that from getting chubby?
X: What? No, man, it's just restless leg.
X: Oop! My bad.
X: What are you reading?
X: This old copy of Adventure Boy magazine—the only magazine for boy adventurers. This kid Rusty is getting chased down the river by three grown otters. This magazine rules! But I'm saving the end for tomorrow.
X: Cool.
X: Well, I hope your leg feels better. I'm turning in. I'll see you up there.

X: BMO, PLEASE!

X: Aah!
X: Ooooooo...

X: Aah! Finn! Finn!
X: Aah!
X: Ghost fly, man! Aah! Aah!
X: Okay.
X: Come on, man. Let's get out of the house. It's a ghost fly!
X: So what?
X: No, man, ghost flies are filthy! They carry diseases, such as tuberculosis, polio, dysentery. They leave those little fly doodies on your soul.
X: Aah!
BMO: Finn, Jake! What's wrong?!
X: Ghost fly!
X: Thank goodness we lost him. He's gone.
X: Whoo.
BMO: Run! Just run!
X: Ay-ay-ay-ay!
BMO: Hmm. Kya! Kya!
X: We should ask what its unfinished business is. Ghosts always have unfinished business.
X: Ghost fly, what's your problem?!
X: Come on, dude. Tell us your unfinished business!
X: Aah! It's no good. He's a tortured little spirit. We need help to communicate with this ghost fly.
X: Nah, man, let's just get someone to banish it—someone with serious paranormal juice.
BMO: Is he coming soon?
X: I think so. His ways are kind of mysterious.
X: That's cool.
X: Woo?
X: Let's get this ritual rolling. I got stuff to do.
X: Woo!
X: Hey! No! Unclean demon, feel the sting of holy water!
X: Thank you.
X: we... have...
X: Well, huh. How about that? No biggie. We'll just hang out inside these magic circles until morning. That's when ghosts go to sleep. Yep. Just got to make it... till morning.
X: Woo!
X: Hmm?
X: The end of my story. And it's so close.
X: Don't do it, bro. It's a trap.
X: I know. It's an obvi trap. But wait. What if... watch this. Ha! Mm?
X: Dude, what are you—?
X: If I extend the circle... farther... I can get closer to the magazine.
BMO: Theoretically, that is possible.
X: Yeah, but I'm still getting a "woo-jah" feeling. This seems like a bad idea.
X: Just have to stay inside this circle.
X: Ha ha! How'd you do it, Rusty? How'd you shake them otters?
X: Finn? What's wrong, buddy?
X: Oh, Finn, you're disgusting!
X: Aw, that's it! I've had it with this ghost fly! I wish I were a ghost so I could punch him with my ghost fist!
BMO: Jake, I have a radical option. I've been studying a karate move that could temporarily stop your heart long enough for you to fight the ghost on his own plane of existence.
X: What?
BMO: It's okay! I learned it out of a magazine.
X: All right. But first you got to give me some unfinished business so I can come back as a ghost.
BMO: Tell me a joke.
X: Okay. What do you call a bear that only attacks guys named Paul?
BMO: Kya!
BMO: I killed Jake! Yay, BMO!
X: Whoa! BMO, you killed me. Whoa. Wow. Wow!
BMO: Jake! I can't hear you! I will start your heart up in five minutes, okay? This many!
X: Okay. Five minutes. Whoa.
X: Is this some kind of low-level dead world? That's a bummer.
X: Aah!
X: Aah! Oh, stuff! Aah!
X: Ohh! Ohh! Get away!
X: Aah! You killed it! Aah!
X: Aah! Aah! Get away!
X: Oooooo...
X: Hmm?
X: Hoooooo!
X: That's right. You never finished the soup. That's your unfinished business!
X: Woo-woo.
X: And now that you've finished it, you get to ascend to a glorious, new peaceful realm.
X: What's happening? Oh, BMO must be bringing me back! Yes! Yeah, BMO!
X: Mm. BMO?
X: Jake, I missed you, bro!
BMO: Jake!
X: Don't ever leave me again!
X: Good job, BMO! You brought me back.
BMO: Yes. Yay, BMO. BMO is so good.
X: Whew!


=== S6E20 ===
X: Hey, man.
X: Oh, hey, Finn!
X: Yeah.
X: So... how's your experiment going?
X: Ah, it's goin' great. I really feel like I fit in,
X: So... are you ready to come home?
X: Nah, I think I was just gonna keep being a brick for a while.
X: Umm... what are you doing again?
X: Finn, ever since I was little, I wanted to see what it's like to be a brick in a brick shack when the brick shack falls down. And this shack is gonna fall down. Just look at it. Like sandcastles in the sun, baby. You're too young; you wouldn't understand.
X: You're right. I don't understand. But I'm cool with your mystical journey or whatever. I'm gonna leave this walkie-talkie so we can stay in touch. Just in case.
X: What? No, man, bricks don't stay in touch!
X: Dude, BMO is, like, really worried about you.
X: Aww. You tell that little goofball I said hi.
X: I will. Well, I guess I should head back.
X: Oh. Really? So soon?
X: Yeah, well, it took me, like, half a day to get here. Besides, you're just a brick, right?
X: Yeah.
X: Alright, see ya, Jake!
X: Bye! Okay, back to being a brick. I'm so bored.
X: Ooh, I'm starting to get a little tippy in my teacups.
X: A bunny!
X: Looks like our long-eared friend is on to something. Bunnies love to dig. He's making a supreme effort, and I think I can guess why.
X: That's right. A carrot, grown out here free and wild, probably the result of a seed pooped out by a passing bird.
X: But what's this? A mysterious rustling in the bush. Could mean trouble. Mr. Bunny seems to think so. His sensitive whiskers quiver at the hint of imminent danger.
X: Unfortunately for Mr. Bunny, this is what nature is all about. It's a male deer. Not a threat to Mr. Bunny in the predatory sense, but still above him in the food chain. Mr. Bunny, wishing to avoid an encounter, hops away to safety.
X: Wow, deers are jerks.
X: Hey, man. You know I can hear everything you say, right?
X: What?! Arrrrrgh! No! I had no idea.
X: Yeah, but you saw me leave the walkie-talkie, and I left it on. You know that, right?
BMO: Hi, Jake!
X: Hi, BMO.
X: Need anything? A soda?
X: No.
X: So what's Mr. Bunny doing now?
X: It's not about the bunny! The bunny is incidental to the brick experiment.
X: Oh. Sorry, man.
X: Forget about the bunny.
X: Sorry, man.
BMO: Sorry, Jake.
X: Look, we'll, uh, we'll leave you alone.
X: Finn? Are you still there? Finn? BMO?
X: Mr. Bunny retreats to its warren. Its homemade comfort is some consolation to help pass the hungry night. Twilight falls on the peaceful forest, a twilight unaware of the struggles it both soothes and conceals. The crickets begin to stir, rehearsing their musical rhapsodies. In the distance, flashes of heat lightning illuminate a purple summer sky. Even angry deer, at last, must come to rest. And so it is with our erstwhile antagonist, who has disappeared into a stand of trees, perhaps to dream of tomorrow's pointless battles.
X: Oh, my Gob, it's a crazy storm! This might be it! This weather might knock the whole thing down!
X: If a definition of bravery exists, then this must be it. A lone bunny, facing off against the elements, ineffectually pushing around some twigs with his pink bunny nose, a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but sometimes that's all we have. The wind is beginning to pick up. It's becoming clear that Mother Nature has not just knocked on the door, she has come in, sat down, and poured herself a drink. Mr. Bunny has no friends, no family, no loved ones of any kind. The wind is really picking up now. Small puddles gathering around the entrance to Mr. Bunny's cozy home are beginning to grow in size and connect with one another. It won't be long now. But what's this?! Looks like this unflagging little hero of a bunny will have some help, though! A family of friendly beavers appears to have taken up the cause.
X: Often called nature's architects, these intrepid mammals are sparing no effort to shore up the endangered burrow. Here's an unusual sight. It's a Sea Lard! You'd expect to see a few mudscamps out in weather like this, but here we have a rare treat indeed. This little beauty is pretty far outside of her natural habitat, but I've heard it said by wise old salts schooled in ancient maritime lore that storms will sometimes blow them off course to a remarkable degree. Looks like we've got some pretty good evidence tonight. Yes, sir, sometimes those old sailors know what they're talking about. It's a triumph of experience versus the secondhand verities of musty academic tomes. This feisty Sea Lard is pitchin' right in to save the rabbit hole, belying its slothful reputation. She uses her prodigious swiveling behind to increase the size of the hole, while the beavers continue to reinforce the sides with straw and stick. Times like these, supposed cruelty and indifference of the natural world, all too often its most salient feature, pale before the nobler instincts of even our most humble kin.
X: In the morning light, few signs remain of the summer storm that battered this idyllic glen. The beavers are finished with their work and are heading home. The Sea Lard looks like she's gonna wander the woods for a while. Maybe she'll find her way back to the ocean and write a novel about her experiences. Mr. Bunny is exhausted but can rest easy knowing that his home is secure. But alas, the bunny's rest is short-lived. The deer is back.
X: The deer, perhaps confused by the antler-like appearance of Mr. Bunny's protective dam, is now testing the situation.
X: The bunny is unsure of where this is going.
X: And with a single smash from the deer's powerful front hooves, the bunny's home is under attack! Mr. Bunny has hopped to safety and can only watch as the deer continues its relentless rampage on the only home he knows. A couple more mighty smashes, and the dam—the dam has been breached! Water is now flooding in! The deer continues its attack! This deer's misplaced rage, combined with its size and weight, is more than enough to bring down the weakened walls, which are now starting to give, aided by the unforgiving weigh from the tree above. Even Mr. Deer, in his blind fury, seems to sense what's about to happen as he steps to one side!
X: It's over. The warren has been destroyed.
X: An injustice of astronomical levels. Words fail me.
X: Actually, he doesn't seem that upset.
X: He's on his feet, checking out his new surroundings—even the deer is impressed! As if confused by the events, he performs a comical double-take and retreats into the forest. Ladies and gentlemen, this bunny is indomitable!
X: Teach me, Mr. B!
X: Aw.
X: Jake? Jake? You there, buddy? Over.
X: Hey, Finn.
X: Hey, man. You ready to come home?
X: That sounds good.
X: Awesome. See you soon. Yus!


=== S6E28 ===
X: Commence dinner.
X: Dinner is concluded.
X: Up.
X: Ooh!
X: Mm. Lights out!
X: Huh?!
X: Bye.
X: Better get up here, Jake. It's about to happen.
X: Coming! Just gotta get this cocoa pipin'.
X: Your loss, man. The Dap of the Heavens only happens every 20 years. Oh, man. It's going down.
X: Okay. Let's watch some stars.
X: Hmm. You missed it. It was honestly a little disappointing.
X: Oh. Okay. Hey, man, I think I hear something weird over there with my little doggy ears.
X: Phew! You are killing, Cinnamon Bun! This routine is locked up!
X: Oh! Thank you, Princess. You are also killing.
X: You mean Flame Princess?
X: Naw, man. What I heard didn't sound like her. Give me a peek on there. This is pretty much just a tube. Huh. It's Lemongrab.
X: Uh, Lemongrab?! What's he up to at this time of night?
X: Uh... it looks like he's headed for the Mountain of Matthew. I hear beaucoup spookoo legends about that place.
X: Beaucoup spookoo, you say? We should follow him.
X: Huh? How come you care where Lemongrab goes?
X: He could, you know, he could be messing with crazy mystic power at that mountain. It's like seeing a baby playing with dynamite. Plus, seeing Flame Princess kind of messed me up. Now I gotta distract myself with work.
X: Okay, okay. I feel you. Let's do some things.
X: There's his Lemon Camel. Lemongrease must be inside already.
X: Whoa!
X: Huh? C'mon man!
X: Nope.
X: Nuh uh.
X: Dang it! Quit bustin' my buns!
X: You have no beeswax in the Mountain of Matthew, supple yellow dog. But you, plucky adolescent, you have way cray beeswax.
X: You gonna be okay by yourself?
X: Yeah, man.
X: Okay. Just gonna sit down over here—
X: Not even.
X: Dong it!
X: Rocks. Dripping water. More rocks. Oh, I'm becoming stressed!
X: Continue forward.
X: Hmm?
X: To reach me, you must choose correctly.
X: Aah!
X: Come, Earl of Lemongrab! Let us play the game of catch. I am eager to relate to you.
X: Yes. I desire this, as well. Huh?
X: Thank you! Thank you all! As your younger, more relatable new ruler, I shall endeavor to undo all the order imposed by my predecessor!
X: I unaccept!
X: No, Lemongrab! You are unacceptable!
X: Prepare to be served in a pitcher by a little child!
X: What a wondrous time you've experienced, and tomorrow there will be more adventures to be had for little Lemonsweets.
X: Ooh, wave farewell! What a lucky little boy you are to live so gaily.
X: Lemonsweets.
X: Choose.
X: Ohh!
X: Lemongrab! We understand your styles. We are of the same styles.
X: Eee! Aaaaaaaaaaah!
X: No! It is my love that he prefers! He is spiteful of your love!
X: Don't hurt him! Ohhh! Ohhh! Aaaah! Ohhhh! I'm inside you! Aaaaah!
X: Taste the grease, Lemongrab.
X: Okay. It's lemony.
X: Look up, man.
X: Aaaaaah! I am grease?!
X: Lemongrab, where you at?! Uh, cool.
X: To reach me, you must choose correctly.
X: Who's that Matthew? Whuh-oh!
X: Yo, get up, C.B.! This routine's got to be high-level outside the box!
X: Hey, Finn, quick! Be me, bro! Be me, bro!
X: Oh, yeah! It's time, BMO!
BMO: What is it? I can't smell.
X: Finn Cakes, boy!
BMO: Yummy! Ooh.
X: Yo. Dang. Finn Cakes. That's not fair.
X: Okay. Goodbye, lemongrease.
X: Goodbye, where?
X: Goodbye from my grease body into the blackness, where only my pure essence can go!
X: Up-up, BMO. Finn always gets the first Finn Cake.
BMO: Yo, give me a break.
X: Pure essence! Eject! Blorg! Bleject!
X: Lemongrab! Huh? Whoo!
X: Later, spirit bro.
X: Lemongrab, you okay?!
X: Finn, don't mess me up.
X: Hi, Finn.
X: You're Matthew, huh? Your rep precedes you, bro. "Proceeds"?
X: What kind of rep?
X: Some stuff Jake said that I interpreted as negative.
X: Well, ask yourself if that feels right.
X: The meat bodies who've journeyed to this mountain have distilled themselves to their original source materials and now exist in oneness.
X: Oneness? That's you, bro?
X: I keep adding to myself until the second age of terror, when I will emerge in my final form and restore the world.
X: That's why you're here, L.G.? To merge with Matthew?
X: It is one option, to know the ecstasy of my ego death.
X: Oh. Well, nice knowing you? I mean, I know you got issues. But you're, uh...
X: I know.
X: Are you sure, though?
X: Here's my other option. You see these? Lemonjons?
X: Uh-oh.
X: These lemonjons are me, and I wonder if they can destroy you.
X: Ooh, boy. Lemongrab, hold up!
X: If you are the head that blooms atop the ziggurat, then the stairs that lead to you must be infinite!
X: Careful with those metaphors, bro!
X: Infinite stairs are unacceptable!
X: Ohh. Aaaaah!
X: Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Geez!
X: Oh, no, bro! Heck, no, bro!
X: Aaaah!
X: Yo!
X: Smash that Lemongrab!
X: Try it, grease!
X: Yes! Pow! Yeah! I got you, bro!
X: Why are you being so opaque about not letting me in there?
X: Well, get out a pen and paper and I'll school you on this biz.
X: Gol' ding!
X: Dude, I was gonna ask him to move.
X: Oh.
X: Yo, class, hold on. Uh...
X: I'm done! Let's go!
X: Okay. Here we are.
X: Bye! Aaaaaah!
X: Yo, yo! It's grease!


=== S6E29 ===
BMO: Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Sick! Sick! So sick! Dying!
X: Check it out. I got snacks for while we wait. For Marcy, red lick-rish.
X: Thanks.
X: And for BMO...
BMO: Fresh boys!
X: So, Finn... What are we waiting here for?
X: What? Dude, it's Super Porp Day.
X: Yeah. Don't you know about Super Porp Day?
X: Wait. "Super Porp"... like in the old commercials? Uh, let's see, like, ♪Super Porp, it hits the spot, messes up your train of thought. If you're thirsty and out of shape...♪
X: ♪Get down on that fizzy grape!♪
X: Yeah, yeah. That's the one.
X: Today's the day when Squeez-E-Mart always gets their monthly shipment.
X: What? That's really weird, guys. Why would s—
BMO: Stop talking! Here it comes!
X: Enjoy Super Porp!
BMO: I love you, Cheryl.
X: Man, this biz takes me back. I used to drink this stuff all the time when I was a kid.
X: What? That's not right. How could the exact same soda still be in production hundreds of years after the great Mushroom Wars?
X: Okay, listen. So, okay, we could go track down the mysterious source of Super Porp. Do up a fuh-real, end up fightin' some big soda-computer-god-baby or whatever... We totally could. But... Super Porp is good. So why question this good thing, man? Why?
X: Hmm. Yeah, okay. Let's just go home.
BMO: Yay! Super Porp! Yay! BMO!
X: Super Porp! Super Porp! Super Porp!
X: Enjoy Super Porp!
X: We will, Cheryl!
X: No, Cheryl. Susan will not enjoy!
X: Chill out, Susan Strong.
X: Yeah. Super Porp taste good! Super Porp is good!
X: No. It fake juice. Tough-guy hyoomans do not drink fake juice.
X: Hmph. Go away, robots!
X: Baby? Baby!
X: Eh?! Baby! Baby!
X: Baby.
X: Baby.
X: Porp fountain.
X: Hmm?
X: Hmm?
X: Hello, and welcome to the original Super Porp factory! Are you ready to get porrrped? I-I-I think we all need to get poooorped.
X: Baby!
X: Susan killed Cheryl!
X: This is fake style bubblehead. Cheryl trying to trick us!
X: Baby! That hole too small for Susan.
X: If Sally say so... Hup! Hyah!
X: You two, follow baby cries.
X: Susan will find other way. Hmm?
X: ♪Super Porp, it hits the spot. It messes up your train of thought. If you're thirsty and out of shape, get down on that fizzy grape! Super Porp!♪
X: Uh.
X: Hey! No one is allowed to taste pure Porp syrup! You know this, Carla.
X: But it looks sooo good!
X: Well, of course it does! I mean, I'd smash everyone's face in this room for a single drop of pure Porp, but that's not the Super Porp way.
X: Aw, cheer up, girl. Maybe we'll get bonus reg Porp after that new baby gets processed.
X: Baby!
X: Hey, where's your hairnet?!
X: Ow! W-w-where's your hairnet? Where's your hairnet?

=== S6E33 ===
X: Whoo-hoo-hoo!
X: 안녕. ("Hello.")
X: Hey bear dude, sorry to drop in like that.
X: Oh, hey... brother.
X: Whoa. Jermaine?! We must be dreaming at the same time again.
X: Yeah.
X: I was just hanging out with a couple of ladies outside... or a couple of the same lady. Then bam! Sky-boxed!
X: Ugh. Jake, I'm here to work. I got to keep everything where it should be. So, uh... so how are you and Finn doing?
X: Whoop! Ah!
X: Uh...
X: Jermaine? You okay, man?
X: No, no, I'm--I'm fine. Everything's fine.
X: Oh.
X: epsilon, eucradies, dernesto...
X: Hey, listen, um, maybe we should get together in the awake world? You know, meet in meat-space?
X: Uh, yeah. Sounds great. See you later.
X: In the dream, Jermaine was wearing a bear suit. I wonder what that symbolizes. Maybe it means Jermaine needs us to visit.
BMO: Workout time!
X: You want the can or the cup?
X: I like the can.
X: Or if Viola shoved Jake Jr. down a dream hole.
X: I don't know. Jermaine's always been kind of a dream hole.
BMO: Whoa.
X: We're all getting older. We should go see him now, or we might regret it.
X: Eh. It's not a great time just this minute. Trying to figure this deal out.
BMO: Woah!
X: Okay. Let's go see Jermaine.
X: There's a lot more demons here than I remember.
X: Huh. Yeah. The only constant is change, bro.
X: I want my yo-yo!
X: Yo, yo! That's rude, dude!
X: Give me my cup!
X: Huh?
X: Bring me my cup, or I'll skull-cup you!
X: Yipe!
X: Jake!
X: Woah!
X: Oh, you guys really came. Quick, get behind the salt barrier!
X: They can't cross the circle. It's made from Dad's old shaman-blessed, sage-infused salt.
X: Return my cup! Return my cup-- Stop poking me!
X: Knock it off, guys. Just get in the house.
X: You guys can chill here 'till morning, when the demons thin out a little.
X: Whoo!
X: Oh, Finn--Oh no! Instant regret!
X: Whoo! My house, my house!
X: Instant regret!
X: Whoo! Remember, Jermaine? We did this when we wanted to make room for dessert!
X: I don't care about that memory!
X: What?
X: Whoa--Ohh! Dang, my back.
X: Come on! This ain't the treehouse, man! I got systems!
X: Hey Jermaine, this thing is rad--Whoa!
X: Okay, no more sleepover!
X: Oh no! Don't--don't kick us out!
X: Go do your Gaucho Marx slapstick with them goofballs in the woods. I got a responsibility to all this booty in here--Staves, medallions, cups, goblets, dormant jinn, grimoires, hard-drives... All this random valuable booty, okay?
X: Oh, shoot.
X: I gotta run this beast.
X: Open, ya sissy!
X: Yeah, flip the tape, I know.
X: "Good times." Right.
X: Hey! I'm Booboo Sousa! You want to be friends?
X: We've been friends, Booboo.
X: You're slippin', Jerm.
X: No I'm not.
X: You're gonna miss that alarm one day, and I'm gonna eat you from the bottom up, so you can watch me while I eat you. Then, in my triumph, I will retrieve the poster your dad stole from me.
X: Bryce, I put the poster right there. You're still mad about that?
X: How dare you use tacks on my poster! You're gonna get it, man!
X: You know, Bryce, I would've let you and your poster go years ago if you'd stop it with all that "from the bottom up" talk.
X: You would?
X: Yeah, man! I don't want to flip that tape all day! That's you and Joshua beef 'cause you wouldn't stop breaking in for that poster.
X: Well, come on man, let's be bros!
X: No way, you psycho. I ain't never gonna trust you after all that stuff you said.
X: I'm gonna taste that dog carne asada, you hear?!
[Cut to the basement entrance, where Finn and Jake are standing with expressions of shock.
X: You're never gonna taste my carne asada, Bryce.
X: Dude, you can't live like this!
X: Yeah, you got a plan B for Bryce, or what?
X: I don't need a plan B. I'm responsible. You guys want fried rice or something? I can make fried rice.
X: No, Jermaine, we'll make you fried rice.
X: Okay, just don't break any more junk. That's our parents' valuable artifacts, you knuckleheads.
X: I'm gonna white-knuckle you, Jermaine! You'll see!
X: Whoo-hoo! I've never even made fried rice before! Get the plates.
X: Whoosh!
X: Good plating. Sorry I only have one chair.
X: To brothers!
X: To brothers!
X: It doesn't have to be weird, you guys!
X: What's that sound? It sounds like howling.
X: Let's eat!
X: Dang, dude, this fried rice destroys. How'd you get all this flavor?
X: Sesame oil and salt. Salt is one of the five taste sensations.
X: Sweet, sour, bitter, umami and salty.
X: I guess I'm just used to bitter. That's weird. I haven't had salt in like five years. Hold on...
X: Epsilon, eucradies, dernesto, quillduct... Uh, where'd you get the salt from, Jake?
X: I snooched a little from outside. Why?
X: Get my cup, Ariel! Please, dude!
X: You get it! I need my DAT tapes.
X: I can't fit through that hole Ariel! Aaaah!
I'll shock him, and you guys ace his brains!
X: Got it!
X: That sword's too unweildy, man.
X: But it'll look decent when I triple combo this bozo with this thing, right?
X: Like how?
X: Like this, bro!
[Jake spins around, tries to raise the sword and falls on his back in front of the door instead.
X: Aah! Oof!
X: Boo, stupid!
X: Where's my DAT tapes?!
X: Epsilon, eudradies, epilindus...
X: Oof! Why is this thing so dense?
X: I got your tapes over here!
X: Give me my ta--Oof! Aah!
X: I got him! Hup!
X: Sha-boom! Woah, watch it!
X: Cut his arms, Finn!
X: Okay!
X: Woah!
X: Wha--?
X: Aaaaah!
X: My cup, Jermaine!
X: Oof!
X: You're a pain, Jermaine!
X: Jermaine the pain! Jermaine the pain!
X: Awesome, dude! We won!
X: I didn't win! When do I win?! Special guys one and two win every day! Crackin' jokes, readin' foodie mags in your tree-town fun-house. Must be nice to be so special you can go off and find your own fancy ways! Meanwhile I gotta stay here and watch Dad's trashy booty 'cause I never stretched into the sky and farted on the wings of a falcon, I guess!
X: Dude, I never farted on the wing of a falcon.
X: Bros!
X: Chill, Jermaine.
X: Huh?
X: Yeowch!
X: I'm sick of bein' Daddy's watchdog.
X: This must've been building up for a while.
X: Woah!
X: Wah!
[Finn's sword pokes out from the hand and cuts it in half, leaving fire in its wake. Finn jumps out from inside the hand. His sword remains on fire.
X: Hand fire.
X: You got to be Dad's favorite! I got stuck with his mess!
X: Come on. Dad didn't have a favorite. He just liked my fart jokes.
X: I'm the fart joke!
X: Shazbaz! Uh, no. Shazbaz!
X: Ow. Dad loved us both. You could've left any time.
X: I know!
X: If you punch me again I'm gonna fart.
X: Oh man. I've really built my own cage.
X: Guys, guys, guys!
X: This whole place is burning down!
X: So if you're done being angry bonkers, let's work together!
X: Jermaine? You gonna leave me hanging, bro?
X: Let it burn.
X: Huh?!
X: But all of Dad's stuff!
X: No... I think it's all right.
X: The salt line got broken. Where'd all the d's go?
X: Maybe with all their stuff gone they had no reason to stay.
X: Oh, no! The tape!
X: Open...!
X: I got my poster!
X: Booboo Sousa...
X: I ate his stupid face off! It was sick.
X: Ugh. Do you even know what you sound like when you talk like that?
X: I sound cool.
X: If that's what you think.
X: That's what I know.
X: Dang. Has it always been so bright out here? Makes me wanna explode the sun and banish the Earth into darkness.
X: See? You're doing it again!

X: Chips?
X: Ice cream?
X: Chips! Chips. Ch-i-ips!
X: Ice cream!
X: I don't get it.
X: Ah, just keep watching. BMO said the second act gets crazy.
X: Chips chips chips. Chips chips... Chips!
X: Ice cream!
X: Chips...
X: Ice cream...
BMO: Bravo!
X: What the stuff was that?!
X: Come on, kids! We're going to grandma's.
BMO: Dinner? Please can we invite him to dinner?
X: No.
BMO: But, Jake, I never ask you for anything. When did I ever ask you for anything?
BMO: Yesterday. You said, "Jake, please take me to see Chips and Ice Cream! It's a Broadway smash!" And I believed you.
BMO: You don't understand me, Jake.
X: Yeah. Dinner sounds great! Yeah! Wait. The place where you eat dinner, does the moon shine through the window at night?
X: Sure.
X: All right! Let's do it!
BMO: Oh, ooh! And when Chips trips over the turtle, it was so funny! But also sad. It made me think about the fragility of my own life.
X: Just a little more...
X: Hey, y'all ready for some sushi burgers?
X: Mm, I don't eat burgers. Got any chips and ice cream?
X: Uh..Sure. I just sculpted these buns though.
BMO: Give the man what he wants! Soo, is your name Chips and Ice cream?
X: My name is Morty Rogers.
BMO: I see.
X: Let's all dig in! Yes, eat it. Eat that chips and ice cream.
BMO: Oh, yes sir!
X: Chips chips chips?
X: Ice cream ice cream.
BMO: No...Flipping...Way!
X: and is currently eating chips and ice cream!
X: Chips chips?!
X: Ice cream...
X: Huh
X: Well, now I'm a guy with these things on my head. I guess I'm just gonna roll with the punches.
X: Uh... Don't worry, man. I'm gonna pretend they're not even there.
X: Chips!
X: Ice cream!
BMO: This is the greatest day of my liiife!
X: Maybe if I put a towel over my head they'll go to sleep.
X: Huh. What's on your head? I don't even notice it.
X: Heh. Yeah, okay.
X: Chips chips.
X: Ice cream.
BMO: Huh?
X: Chips...!

BMO: I'm onto something important!
X: Quit clownin' around.
BMO: Chips chips.

X: Chips.
X: Yeah, we have chips.
X: Ice cream?
X: Sorry. I don't have any ice cream, but I know who does. Hey, John!
X: Yo!
X: I gots a customer for yas. I'll bag these for ya.
X: Yo! I got ice creams!
X: Ice cream?
X: I recommend the hamburger flavor. Also, the pizza flavor is tremendous!
X: Do you have taco?
X: One second! One taco flavored.
X: You have the best!
X: You have the best, out-of-this-world day. What's your spectacular choice?
X: No. No! Stay away! You can't make me take them back!
X: Oh hey, Morty Rogers.
X: Ice cream!
X: Tremendous.
X: Oh! I hope the record is not scratched or chipped. Chip. Ice cream. [Grabs buttons and sewing thread from a drawer.
X: Chips chips chips.

X: Chips chips! Chip chip. Ice cream! Ice cream!
X: Hush! Hush! Hush! Nyahah!
X: I thought I could just ignore them, but I can't! Chips and Ice Cream have to go!
X: Listen. Even if I could find Morty Rogers again, I don't know how to get these things to go back to him or even if they want to.
X: Chips chips!
X: Ice cream!
BMO: Chips? Chips chips chips! Ice cream?
BMO: I know what we have to do.
X: I don't want you!
X: I..must..I..must!
BMO: He's here!
X: I love you, Chips and Ice Cream. I hope you never leave.
X: No! Those are my Chips and Ice Cream! By the light of the waxing moon, which was just unveiled by the parting clouds, transfer those two imps that have taken possession of Jake's ears to the head of the being who is watching from the window! Chips and Ice Cream!
X: BMO, it's happening!
X: No! My Chips! And Ice Cream!
BMO: Free!
X: Noooo!
X: Whoa.
X: What's going on?
BMO: Chips and Ice Cream wanted to be free. But they could only be if I interrupted the transference ritual.
X: Free? I'm sorry for keeping you dudes as my prisoners for so many years. But what am I gonna do without you?!
X: Chips.
X: Ice cream.
X: What?

X: Hello-lable!
X: Cuber? Lable brother? Where are you?
X: Oh, this cave air is doing wonders for my physiological... Bable, bable, bable, bable, bable...
X: Oh! Aaaaaaah! Oh! But I'm a baby! Tuber? Sister Tuber? Bable, bable, bable...
X: Aaaaaaah!
X: Hmm? Aah! Oh, you surprised your old pal, Cuber aboard his spaceship. Oh, this old grayble?
X: 내 신부를 위해 복수할 기다! (I will revenge for my bride!)
X: Wable. Bable, bable. Bable, bable, bable.
X: Oh! Trust your graybles. Oh, and you children at home, don't bother trying to guess tonight's theme. Applesauce to a theme! Your friend Cuber doesn't want to die!
BMO: Oh, come on.
BMO: It's Finn. Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a cliff diver!
X: What?!
X: BMO, you got to let me dig this hole. It's important.
BMO: A hole, you say?
X: Yeah. We beat this evil wizard, see, and we stole his giant wand.
X: Don't listen to him, BMO. I beat the wizard, so I'm making Finn dig the hole, even though I could do it in like two seconds. Heh, heh, heh.
BMO: Rude!
X: This wand is crazy powerful, right? It's a thought cannon. It makes anything that you think of turn real.
BMO: Up, please.
X: So it's too strong, so we're burying it for safety.
X: I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd use that cannon and imagine a hole.
BMO: Jake, remember what they say about absolutely power.
X: I'm tired of your wisdom, BMO! Now watch and learn! Yeah, okay, my name's Jake, and I'm gonna take this magic thought cannon, and I'm gonna think, I want a hole to bury this thought cannon in, and bobble, bobble, Jake gets a hole in which a thought cannon may be buried!
X: What if for a split second you think of something else?
X: Nope, my brain's my hands!
X: Whoops! Looks like I was thinking about a sandwich. Enjoy your labor! Heh, heh, heh.
BMO: I used to wish I was you. Now I just wish you would dig faster.
X: Could it be the aformabled thought cannon? "Bobble, bobble" as the dead might say. That's the power of graybles.
X: 에잇, 누가던진거야 이거?(Shoot, who threw this thing?)
X: 잠깐, 너 방금전...(Wait, you just...)
X: I guess here goes bable.
X: You try not to think of a sandwich, and look what happens! A sandwich!
X: Ow! Mama's milk! Oh, my mama's milk! Oh, that milk! Graybles!
X: Hello! How are you?! Oh! Gunther, did you see how this happened?
X: I love you, Gunther, but I'm on to your business.
X: Hmm, just like that, huh? And...
X: You can do it, Cuber.
X: You can do it, Cuber. You can run away. Now what? Maybe grayble.
X: I see that Mr. Cupcake is at Madam Eclair's apartment again. His massage business is really taking off. Hmm.
X: Starchy?
X: Yes, sir. Starchy is just going for a walk.
X: Well, I'm just gonna pick these flowers now. No holes.
X: Yeah, in the ear. Oh, I mean, in the rear. That's what all the walking's good for -- gives me self-esteem to have a nice rear.
X: Aah! Oh! No! Agh! Mercy from the wet eyes!
X: Whoa!
X: Unh!
X: Starchy?! Did Starchy just die?
X: Hey, hey!
X: Things looking up.
X: Thank you.

X: I'm a hero!
X: Now, wasn't that a thing! We've had laffs and gaffs, thribbles and chibbles, some close calls, secrets and questions, and memories to share. We barely made it out with our scaybles... All thanks to graybles. Sister Tuber? I'm sorry for this mess. I love you.

X: Man, birthday-holiday overlap. That's some tough luck. Everyone's all jollied-out when it's your turn for jollies.
X: Well... you know, it's not actually the holidays. Plus, BMO wasn't actually even born.
X: Well, I suppose. But you don't got to be so technical about it.
X: Listen, all I'm saying is we—
X: Hello?
X: Hey, it's me. Is there a big rainbow over your house right now spelling out "Happy birthday, BMO"?
X: No. Actually, it's snowing like crazy.
X: Okay, that's what I was afraid of.
X: Peppermint Butler spilled grape juice on my experimental weather machine, and now it's going kablooey.
X: I got to stay here to fix this thing. Tell BMO I'm sorry I missed the party.
X: That's okay. BMO doesn't care any—
X: BMO only cares about one special guest.
BMO: Moe! Hooray! Moe is coming! And he brought me a special surprise for my birthday! Moe is the smartest man in the world.
BMO: He's way smarter than you and you and you, too, Jake—and you're the smartest guy I know.
X: Hey, thanks.
BMO: And he knows everything about robots. He built me, and he built himself, and all the other MOs. He's so smart! I bet he could even fix Neptr.
X: What? What's wrong with me?
BMO: Oh, boy, oh, boy! He's here! Oh. You are not Moe.
X: Why, of course I am, BMO.
BMO: Oh, okay!
X: Hey, Moe! New haircut?
X: Whoa, Moe! What happened to your body?
X: Oh, oh! Not like little BMO here. You got all my love and affection.
BMO: Thanks!
X: Well, we made a cake.
X: We weren't sure if you eat, but BMO insisted.
BMO: Eating helps me grow!
X: Oh! Well, er, uh... when in Rome.
X: So, BMO, are you ready for your birthday surprise?
BMO: Boy, howdy!
X: For your birthday, I got you...a special mission!
BMO: A mission?
X: A special mission, like a vacation.
BMO: For all of us?
X: No, no, no. A special solo mission.
BMO: For Neptr?
X: No. It's a special rite of passage I designed just for you, BMO. A simple jaunt to the MO factory and back -- that's all -- and you'll be a grown-up.
BMO: Wow.
X: Hmm, I don't know. Sounds kind of dangerous.
X: Yeah, BMO's like a baby almost.
X: Oh, don't be silly. Every other MO has done it since forever.
BMO: But won't I miss Finn and Jake?
X: Oh, sure. But don't worry. They'll be here when you get back.
BMO: But...won't Finn and Jake miss me?
X: Hooray! Hooray!
BMO: Hooray?
X: Hooray!
BMO: Air? Are you there, Air? It's me -- BMO. Maybe I could just stay the same forever.
X: So...
X: So!
X: Um... Yeah, it's nice to see you, Moe.
X: Yeah, you too.
X: Uh... So, Moe, do you want to... uh... Jake?
X: Oh, hey, I'm on my way. One sec.
X: Um, hold on, Moe. Jake, what are you doing?
X: Finn, all this is heck of awkward without BMO -- way more awkward than I thought it'd be. I think maybe I don't like old people. They make me feel like I'm gonna get old one day, too. I'm just gonna stay in this cup for a bit. I'll be out later.
X: You can't do that, it's rude. And what about Princess Bubblegum? She's way old, and you like her.
X: Yeah, but she listens to music. Moe probably only, like, listens to the sound of the earth decaying.
X: Hey, sorry about that, Moe.
X: Boys, I know this is new and different. I am not BMO. But I will do the best to be your friend. This is the daybreak of our lives, and we have all the time in the world to learn about each other. For now, I will be your little robot. Hey, let's get out there and have some fun.
X: I think I'm feeling better now.
X: Oh, whoa! Hey! Hello there, BMO!
BMO: Hello there, DMO. I'm here on a solo birthday mission.
X: Oh, yes, yes, BMO, I know all about it. Moe left special instructions for you. He wants you to stand on that "X" over there.
BMO: Oh, okay. DMO, what happened to you?
X: Oh, this? It-it's nothing. It's just whatever.
BMO: Uh, I don't know about this, DMO. Something doesn't--
BMO: Hello?
X: Boys, look at this! This is cool, right?
X: Oh!
X: Classic!
X: Yeah! Did you see what we did, Moe?
X: We need to go inside and do what I want to do!
X: Oh. O-okay. If -- if you want.
X: Yeah.
BMO: Hello? DMO? Anybody? The "X" door opened, and I fell through. I think something went wrong with the mission. Uh... Abort mission! Unless...maybe this is all part of Moe's plan. Huh?
X: Huh? Who's there? Moe?
BMO: No. It's only me -- BMO.
X: BMO? Oh, thank goodness. Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
BMO: Who are you? Are you a MO, too?
X: Oh, BMO, no, no, no. I am ALLMOs.
BMO: ALLMOs? I don't understand.
X: Of course not. I'm so sorry. Let me explain.
X: Peace had reigned in Moe's wondrous factory for a hundred hundred years. There was a place for every MO, and every MO was in its place. If you wanted a free hug, all you had to do was ask. No one could say no -- it was a rule. Until one fateful day -- yesterday -- when a mysterious viral signal somehow breached our firewall and was broadcast throughout the factory... instructing all us MOs to do somersaults into the trash compactor all day long.
X: That's horrible.
X: And we've been trapped here all smushed together, ever since.
BMO: That's horrible, too. How -- how do we get out?
X: Well, that's why we're so glad you're here, BMO. You're the key -- the key to escape. Only you can save us now.

X: Let's see, $4 off a... honey-baked ham. I don't like ham. $1 off of beets. Do beets have tannins? What is that? Oh! $4 off a honey-baked ham.
X: Moe?
X: Call me "Gwampa." How's your rose water?
X: It's exactly what it says it is. So, hey, uh, Gwampa, feels too quiet in here. Maybe we can hang out with Neptr. He can rap or something.
X: B-b-b-bread, where's my needle and thread?
X: No!
X: Eh, well, Neptr is too distracting. Who wants to play video games?
X: Oh, you have games like BMO? Let's do that, Gwampa!
X: I have one video game. It's called "Hangman."
X: That sounds griz as nuts!
X: Yeah, let's play hang-a-man!
X: Coming right up! Pick a letter.
X: Show us what you did, hangman!
X: Pick a letter.
BMO: But, ALLMO, I don't understand. How can I help? I mean, I'm just a little baby kid still -- even though it's my birthday -- Happy Birthday, BMO.
X: I don't know about that, but I do know about your special mind. As the accumulation of all MOs, my computing power is unmatched. Yet still, I lack the imagination to think outside my collective programming. I can only see the world as it is. But your imagination, BMO, lets you see the world how it could be, or might sort of be like. If the two of us work together, we can think up a way out of here.
BMO: I will do what I can.
X: All right. You see that hatch over there? That hatch leads to an exit corridor. But it's locked from this side. The vent up there leads to the other side. But it's too high up.
BMO: Oh. to climb up to the vent?
X: But all this trash is too small.
BMO: Ah-huh!
X: Whoa. You just blew my mind.
X: What haven't we guessed yet? "B."
X: "Burgess Meredithe"?! I don't even know what that is!
X: Do you boys want to play again?
X: Boys love games. Pick a letter.
X: Uh, I don't know, "E.' Not cool! Come on, Finn, let's find a real hangman.
BMO: Yuck. This room gives me the heebie-jeebies straight-up.
X: It is the room of AMO, the first of our siblings. He, too, was special. As you were built to give love, AMO was built to receive. But he could not think outside his programming and was blinded by his need. Such is the cruel physics of love -- that those who crave it most will repel it and only the dang rich get richer.
BMO: Well, maybe as my birthday present, I can ask Moe to fix AMO.
X: But this is impossible. Moe went off line yesterday and has not re-logged. Our sensors would know.
BMO: But he's at my house right now with Finn and Jake. He got a new body.
X: Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Did this new body happen to have jagged prongs and a cannon phaser on top of its head?
BMO: No.
X: Phew!
BMO: Uh-oh.
X: What?
BMO: The spikes are under the wig!
X: Oh, no! Of course! Your friends may be in grave danger. He must have sabotaged the factory. Quickly, hoist me up on top of your head. We must depart straightaway.
BMO: Uh...
X: You're stronger than you know.
X: Also, I'm lighter than you know.
X: I'm sorry we didn't find any hangmen.
X: I don't even know what I'd do with a hangman if I got one.
X: Bloo-hoo. Bloo-hoo.
X: Ah, bloo-hoo.
X: Moe!
X: Bandits stole my legs!
X: Yeesh.
X: If you tell us where the bandits went, we'll avenge your legs!
X: We're sorry we left you!
X: You should be. I'm your Gwampa wobot. Carry me. The thief with my legs!
X: Neptr?
X: Throw him out!
X: Come on. Maybe Neptr did it like, accidentally?
X: Neptr's out cold. He's got a heck of a dent on his head.
X: What? Who could have done that?
X: Forget him! You love me, right? You love me like BMO?
X: What? You're all right, but we -- we love BMO.
X: Yeah, man, be cool. BMO's like our best friend.
X: BMO's trash!
X: Moe!
X: "Ah-mo"?
X: You don't love me!
X: Ow!
X: Aah!
X: Wake up and love me!
X: Imposter!
BMO: AMO!
X: Hello, BMO. I'm your cute sibling, AMO.
BMO: I know about you and your dirty hands. Where are Finn and Jake?
X: I think Finn and Jake went somewhere to buy me a gift.
BMO: Tell me what you did with Finn and Jake and our poop.
X: Ay!
X: AYYYYY!
BMO: AMO, look at my face! You gone too far!
X: Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! Bye!
BMO: You can't escape the birthday boy!
X: Too high.
BMO: Hey! Talk, AMO!
X: You want to know where Papa is? Here is all that remains of him -- his memory backup drive.
BMO: Oh.
X: I was returning from a long pilgrimage. I came to confront Papa, for I had discovered terrible things about myself. He was dying. I used his knowledge of the factory and its MOs to destroy them.
X: Is that you, AMO?
X: They didn't love me, either.
X: Where you been? No!
X: Then I learned about you and your new family.
X: People in my life don't love me. I'll obliterate, y'all!
BMO: You cheat. Give me those memories.
X: BMO, I don't want to look at you!
BMO: Tough nuts! For Moe!
X: BMO!
X: Hey. We caught the tail end of what happened. Are you okay?
BMO: No.
X: Well, I don't like that.
X: BMO, will you live with us back at the factory? With Moe gone, you can be our leader.
BMO: I don't think I can. I'm not grown up -- or I'm too grown up now. I think I just killed someone. I need to have some time alone, but you're all really nice.
X: All right.
X: Sorry your birthday was weird.
BMO: That was the craziest thing that ever happened. But I guess, after all that, I do feel a bit more grown.
X: Except that the mission was just some made-up lie.
X: So who knows if I will ever grow up at all.
X: And Moe is gone now.
X: I guess all I can do is listen to the heart Moe gave me.
X: Except that's what AMO did, and he turned out bad.
X: So what if I turn out bad, too?
X: AMO could not think outside his programming and was blinded. But your imagination lets you see the world how it could be.
BMO: But I am different. It's not just Moe up here, it's me, too.
X: And if I cannot trust in Moe, I can trust in me.
BMO: Oh, boy. It sure is confusing being grown.
X: I'm gonna miss you, too, BMO. I feel so very, very proud of you.

BMO: Oh, and by the way, Jake, from now on, you can call me... Angel Face.
BMO: Hyah!
X: Yow!
BMO: I used to be a guy who ran from Glob with the wind at my back and the devil on my shoulder.
BMO: Now I'm the guy chasing those guys, yet the devil is still here, sleeping in my couch.
X: BMO, that hurt when you dug your boots into my side belly.
X: Are you gonna apologize or...
BMO: Horses do not talk.
BMO: Over there! Hyah!
BMO: Whoa!
BMO: Jackrabbit Johnson.
BMO: This guy's wanted for stealing piglets from their mothers while they are feeding.
BMO: Makes me sick.
BMO: He was last seen in dead goat gulch.
BMO: What do you say, girl?
BMO: Want to catch this donkey and split the reward?
X: You have 45 minutes left before my next sammich.
BMO: Time's a-wasting!
X: Hyee!
BMO: Hmm.
X: BMO, I'm tired.
BMO: Looks like my horse needs a rest.
BMO: Slow down, horse.
BMO: ♪ Being a robot cowboy ♪
BMO: ♪ Is a lonely job ♪
BMO: ♪ But somebody has to protect the piglets ♪
BMO: ♪ I got nobody but my horse ♪
BMO: ♪ And my friend the cactus guy ♪
BMO: ♪ It's okay because I like them a lot ♪
BMO: ♪ That's okay, I like being a robot ♪
BMO: ♪ Cowboy ♪
BMO: Be careful, Jake.
BMO: This is where Jackrabbit Johnson's gang of lowlife bandits lays low.
BMO: Hyah!
BMO: Bang! Bang!
BMO: Put them up, partner!
BMO: Hyah!
BMO: Pyew, pyew!
BMO: Pyew, pyew, pyew!
BMO: I want answers!
BMO: You can't do this to us!
BMO: No answers, eh?
BMO: No use to me!
BMO: How about you, frisco?
BMO: I'm not going to talk.
BMO: Why am I talking to you then?!
BMO: Hooah!
BMO: Yah! Unh!
X: BMO, what did you do?
BMO: It's Jackrabbit Johnson's right-hand man, Tumbleweed Terk.
X: I spent the last three months building all of this.
X: Oh, that's where you been?
X: Mm-hmm.
X: BMO gave me a Finn Cake.
BMO: Don't talk to my horse, Tumbleweed.
X: Aah.
BMO: Where is Jackrabbit Johnson?!
BMO: I know you know where he's headed.
X: I don't know!
X: Tumbleweed terk's always the last to know.
X: It's just like I told the other bounty hunter, I swear.
BMO: I don't believe a word you say.
BMO: Now take a message to your compadre.
BMO: Tell him his pal, Angel Face, is itching to get together.
BMO: Tell Jackrabbit Johnson to meet me at Dirtwater Flats, just like the old days!
X: Okay.
BMO: Sock citizens of dead goat gulch, we can rebuild!
X: Neigh!
X: Grrr.
BMO: Uhh...
BMO: I don't remember where Dirtwater Flat is.
BMO: Better stop for the night.
BMO: We can make a campfire here.
BMO: And we will talk about what we will do with the reward money.
X: No.
X: It's been fun, BMO, but it's time to go home because there are no more sandwiches.
BMO: But I want to finish the adventure.
X: Which direction is the house?
BMO: I'm not sure.
BMO: Get down!
X: Getting kicked out of the guild of assassins... check.
X: Capturing my first bounty...
X: Check.
X: Going to Finn and Jake's treehouse and getting revenge...
X: Unchecked.
X: Finn and Jake's treehouse?
X: Mm-hmm.
X: Who are you, and why do you want to get revenge?
X: I... Am... Me-Mow!
X: Me-Mow?! Whoa.
X: You've gotten bigger.
X: Have we met before?
X: Finn, is that you?
BMO: That's Jackrabbit Johnson!
X: Finn?
X: It is Finn!
X: Tricked again!
X: Look... It's me-mow, BMO.
BMO: I don't care.
BMO: That's my bounty!
BMO: Yaah!
BMO: Jake, transform...
BMO: Horse!
X: Whoa, did you have a real gun all this time?
BMO: I am old enough to vote.
X: Hey, Jake, if you can hear my internal monologue, I'm going to kill you!
BMO: Your Daisy days are over!
BMO: I am the whaler 'round these parts!
BMO: Huh.
X: Sounds like you're out of ammo.
BMO: No, you heard incorrectly.
BMO: Bang, bang, bang!
X: I'm coming for you!
X: Ugh!
X: Blast you, Finn and Jake and Angel Face.
X: This prison cell's not going to hold me.
X: Oh?
X: Hey, Finn and Jake! I'll get my revenge! You hear me?! Revenge!
X: Hey, BMO, are you sure you took down all the wanted posters?
BMO: Yes.
X: Stick 'em up.
X: Huh?
BMO: This bounty belongs to me!
BMO: Get out of here!
X: Yaah!
X: Thanks, BMO.
BMO: You're welcome.


=== S7E19 ===
X: Why don't we call, like child services? Or an exterminator?
X: This is gonna work. Just trust me, a'ight?
X: Ugh.
X: Do as I do.
X: Boy, I just love walking through our delightfully not-creepy doorway. Don't you, Jake?
X: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
X: Walking through the not-creepy air to my not-creepy couch, sitting on my not-creepy butt.
BMO: Your butt is kinda creepy.
X: I say 'creepy' is just another label we use to distance ourselves from stuff we don't understand. Or that it reminds us of something in ourselves that we're not comfortable with. I mean, it just ain't an actual thing, you know? Unless you choose to believe it. Right, Jake?
X: It's baloney! It's baloney! It's Starchy's baloney! I just got to think of something wholesome.
X: (as Jake's imagination) 파이 먹자. (Let's eat a pie.)


=== S7E23 ===
X: Wow, everything sucks here!
X: Finn, look!
X: Oh jeez, this looks pretty real. And, wait, is that Billy? Why is he so tiny?
X: Hey, there's our guy!
X: Yeah, just hang out there for a while! I love it! I feel fresh, hahahahahaha!
X: Round and round and round we go!
BMO: Hiya!
X: Oh yeah!
BMO: School's out 'ya trench!
X: Woah! Oof!
X: Hey, Prismo's calling!
X: Nice! Let's go say hi.
BMO: You're lucky I don't take you out, kid! Quit crying baby!
BMO: Oof!
X: OOOOOO!
X: TION!
X: Thanks for responding to my call, guys! I'm in a serious pickle, and I mean the brown kind. I mean like a really smelly, brown pickle.
X: Don't sweat it, boy! Finn and I got yo' back!
X: Who's bullying you Prismo?!
X: Nobody's bullying me. Look, um, remember when you wished the lich never existed and you created a new wish reality that ended up totally not working out?
X: No.
X: Vaguely, yes.
X: What?
X: You don't remember making that wish!
X: Wu-huh?
X: I thought I explained it to you that one time.
X: Dude, I'll catch you up. After you wished the lich never existed, you accidentally created an alternate wish reality where magic doesn't really exist.
X: Wait! . Who's that dude?
X: That's you! But sort of less cool.
X: Uh-huh, proceed.
X: So you find an old Marceline and the crown on the body of Ice King's skeleton who was smushed under the weight of a frozen mitogenic bomb. But then the destiny gang steals your family donkey, so you use the crown to become Ice Finn and save your donkey and your family. But, the crown makes you crazy, and you ice everything up like a dumb bozo, which sets off the mitogenic bomb, which releases the spirit of the lich anyway. But then, this reality's Jake made a counter wish which supposedly fixed the problem, but as it turned out, it didn't really.
X: Can I just say that I don't remember any of this stuff.
X: Because technically it didn't happen to you. But, also it still happened, and that wish reality continues to exist.
X: Is this why all of a sudden one day I was better at the flute.
X: Oh yeah, I noticed that!
X: Listen! Something, really bad, is about to go down. Ice Finn is using his world's Enchiridion to build a portal to the multiverse. I literally do not know what will happen if he succeeds, but it could def's be catastrophic to the architecture of these realities. Now if that happens, my boss, let me repeat that, my BOSS will hold ME responsible, and by proxy, y'all both be in the dip too.
X: Why don't you just bloop bloop it all better?
X: Something there is dampening my powers. I AM LOSING MY PICS OVER THIS BIZ!
X: His boss! Who's that?
X: Alright, man, what do we do?
X: Take this, and use it to take care of the Ice Finn.
X: Oh, wait what do you mean by take care o-
X: Good luck guys we're all depending on you!
X: Woah.
X: What is it?
X: Oh golly!
X: What's that thing now?
X: It's like 50 bowling balls on my teen bod! Oh, check it! There's instructions.
X: Lower it!
X: Ledge ledge ledge!
X: Just a few more jewels before I can open the portal to a better world!
X: My intention to heal the madness of this other self.
X: Wait, wait, wait. I don't think that's what we're supposed to do. Prismo said take care of him.
X: Yeah, that means make him feel better.
X: Are you being stupid on purpose?
X: Yeah, but dude, that is me!
X: That's me!
X: I heard you the first time!
X: There's gotta be something else we can do.
X: Bro, you heard Prismo, we don't have a choice.
X: Ok, but you do it! I just can't man i- it's too messed up.
X: Alright, you're right. Shut your eyes and cover your ears!
X: Mamamamamamama.
X: . Nope! This is bull juice!
X: Oh, flip!
X: Mamamamama-
X: hey, hey!
X: Did you do it?
X: Nah man! Let's just go steal the Enchiridion.
X: Woah yeah! That way he can't open the portal and nobody gets obliterated! That should work!
X: That's not gonna work you guys! Don't walk away from the maid! NOOOOO!
X: What's this? Oh! Two more converts to my empire of frost!?
X: Finn, I love you! Just in case we eat it fighting this guy.
X: Oh, yeah, I love you too.
X: Hahahahahahaha! Wonderful! I thought I'd rescued all the humans! Now you can hang out here with everyone else! Gunther says we just need a few more gems. Anyway, now I'm going to freeze you!
X: WAIT!
X: Huh?!
X: Straight up magic!
X: Are you a wizard too?!
X: Yeah, check out my amazing wizard bod!
X: You can't be!
X: I'm magic, I can do anything! Don't you believe your own eyes?
X: Why would you be able to turn in-
X: Why anything? Why's the sky blue, bro? That's right, just keep looking at me!
X: Hey, what's up?
X: I'll get you out of this, Billy!
X: Look out!
X: Who's that?
X: Enter the por- What? Big Destiny?
X: What's wrong with him? He looks possessed or somethi- ooh, boy, here we go!
X: That's my body, dog!
X: My friend you return! Hahahahaha! This was all his idea!
X: Come on, that's the lich! He's evil! And he's not even trying to hide it, bro!
X: Release!
X: Uhhhh!
X: Woah!
X: Traitor!
X: Jake, let's book it!
X: You dirty gangsters!
X: We're not a gang!
X: Sleep!
X: Bring the book.
X: Ok, buddy! Are we gonna save the world now?
X: Bobby!
X: Open, oh great book!
X: Hahahaha!
X: Hahahahaha! What dimension is this?
X: All of them!
X: That's great! Then we can live everywhere!
X: Everywhere you will die!
X: Heh, what?
X: You, your family, everyone will die.
X: Huh, what the?
X: JAKE! Woah, what the?
X: Gross!
X: You used me!
X: Woah!
X: I trusted you lich!
X: Mathematical!
X: Freeze!
X: Hang on Finn! AAAHHHHH!
X: OW! OW!
X: That's me, kinda. Other Finn, just listen at me. Your name is Finn Mertens! You're best friend is Jake the dog! You have a birthmark like a flaming sideways teardrop! In, like, a really weird place!
X: What? What's going on? Bartrum?
X: Yeah, yeah! Your whole thing is you wanna help people, remember? We can fix all this.
X: It's like the most evil heartburn!
X: JAAAAKE! Get out of the way! . A man needs a maid, a man needs a maid, a man needs a maid!
X: Ding! Housekeeping!
X: AAAAAAAHHHHHH!
X: Bark bark bark!
X: You're Welcome! Ha, I don't know what he's saying. Let's bounce.
X: Prismo, wait!
X: Ok, I can try rearranging some stuff. Just a quick cut,
X: D'aaawwwww!
X: Huh, that's his family.
X: Hey look how dumb I am in that world. Here's me. Woof woof woof! Hahahahaha! I eat stuff off the ground. I don't know, what are dogs even into these days?


=== S7E24 ===
X: Remember last time we were out this way? It was right after you messed things all up with Flame Princess.
X: Yeah, that sucked. But then we found the Dungeon Train, remember? That was awesome.
X: No, it wasn't.
X: Sure it was. Anyway, Flambo's brother's map says the weird cave should be like, right over... Ah! It's right here. Come on, Jake.
X: Okay, hold on. Let me get out my sidewalk chalk. I want to write all over the walls in there.
X: What? You can't use that stuff in here. This is like an ancient, sacred temple.
X: Oh, well, now, that's just great. You don't put traps in the foyer! The foyer is a safe space. Man, not even Jake could smash through this mess. But maybe there's a back door or something.
X: Uh oh! Options. Better leave a little trail in case I get lost. Bread-crumb style. Plus, for if Jake gets in and tries to track me down. Too bad I don't still have that sidewalk ch... Oh!
X: Okay, well, scratch that. Now I really hope there's another way out.
X: Hall of Egress. Egress, egress.
X: What's 'egress' mean?
X: Exit.
X: Egress means exit!
X: Great. What am I supposed to do now?
X: Wait. Hey. Hey, I just smashed you. I... Ah... Magic door, okay. Right, but if I...
X: Well done, Finn. You solved the magic door. That ought to have done it, and... Oh. This door is too tricky for me. Guess I better give up, right? Wrong, wrong! Let's try that again.
X: Hmm. Smooth like metal. Floor's smooth too. What have we here? An errant thread! Spike trap. Better head back and regroup.
X: Fiendish. Anyway, don't let's do that again.
X: And right then straight. And... Hey now. Hold the phone, there should be a left turn here. Letters? E... G... 'Egress'. It spells 'egress'. This way! And here's another one, and another... Whoa!
X: Okay. So, every map I make is wrong. All the exit signs led to traps. Plus the braille, the hieroglyphics, and the tape recorder message too. It's almost like the maze is trying to tell me something. Something confusing, whatever! Who needs anyway with your stupid signs and messages? I'm Finn Mertens, ya heard? And I don't need no nothing! Watch me.
X: Finn? Fi-inn!
X: Jake! Jake, I'm coming!
X: Finn? Where are ya, buddy?
X: Jake!
X: That's a little disappointing. Still, though. I'm in the homestretch here.
X: Jake!
X: Finn! There you are.
X: Yeah. Sorry to pop up, then disappear again like that.
X: Again? You just got here, son.
X: I did? Shoot, man. This cave has got me straight scrambled up and down.
X: What cave?
X: What? Oh. Uh oh.
X: Well?
X: Well, I followed your map, but there's just a bunch of grass here.
X: What? Let me see!
X: Dang it.
X: So, yeah. Everything I did to try to make sense of the maze or to play it safe totally backfired, but when I got fed up, and started just charging in willy-nilly, I was able to get to the end and find you.
X: And then the whole thing disappeared. But I wonder how come I don't remember any of it.
X: I don't know. I'm just hoping, maybe if I sleep it off, maybe I'll be better in the morning.
X: Okay, well... Good night, buddy.
X: Thanks, Jake. Good night.
BMO: Are you awake?
X: Yes.
BMO: Are you gonna open your eyes now?
X: Maybe.
BMO: Are you scared?
X: No.
BMO: Then do it.
X: On three.
X: One, two, three,...
X: So, been almost a month now. What do you think? You wanna try opening 'em? It's beautiful day. Plus, I need someone to tell me if this hat looks cool.
X: Man I told you. If I open 'em now, it'll just be the same. I got to wait till something's different.
X: Yeah, that makes sense, I guess. So, um, I got you a little something, a little present.
X: Wow, thanks man!
X: You're really gonna thank me. Gotcha!
X: No!
X: Yeah, you've done it, like, 30 times now.
X: It's like programmed into your DNA or something.
X: Well, shoot, man. If I wanna do it that bad, it must be kinda right, right?
X: Look at it from where I'm sitting. All this funky pizzazz that only you can see, that's like the literal definition of a hallucination, either all that stuff is a dream or like, I'm a dream. And I ain't no dream, ya heard?
X: Yeah, I know, I heard. It's just that, well...
BMO: Hyah! Open up!
X: Oh, Jake, I know you mean well, but I guess I got to see this one through on my own. I'll see you around, buddy.
X: Huh? What the... How long has this been going on? Someone's apt to track me down, bread-crumb style, e.g. Jake. Can't let him catch me. No more threads to follow. No more egress.
X: Hmm. It's cool in here... Ain't nothing wrong with that. Deep too. That's good. Ain't nobody gonna be looking for me down. Ugh! Egress! Egress! Egress! Egress!
X: Something's different.
X: Hurry, Finn. At the seashell's center lies, the cornucopia's smallest door.
X: Whoa! That must have been some cave!
X: No comment!


=== S7E25 ===
X: BMO, I've been playing this 72 hours straight. Can I please save after this battle?
BMO: No, it takes up too much brain space.
X: I'm out of candles. Huh? Man, if Finn were here, we'd be doing this in shifts. Oh, well, let's keep grinding.
BMO: I cannot talk and run this game at the same time.
X: Well, I guess that means I'm free. I live again!
X: ♪My name is Jake, and love my life. Kissin' on lady 'cause she's basically my wife. Fixin' up Neptr 'cause he fell from a tree. Catchin' up with Maja and Aptwe.♪
X: ♪Maja's in a coma, and she might not wake up.♪
X: ♪I'm glad you got a friend now even though that's messed up. Take T.V. to the market to get him into fruits. Take a little nappy in my blanket cocoon... Wake up really early just to cook for my friends. Later in the field at night I thought I saw death. Made myself a boat, and I sailed with a whale. Took T.V. to the market so he could try kale. And some other stuff...♪ Ah!
X: Nice song, Jake.
X: What a crazy 2 weeks. I think I'm ready to hole up and go round tow on 'Age of Grinders'. But where's Finn? I need him on this adventure.
X: Uh, well...
X: Hold on. What?
X: If you don't know, I'm not sure it's my business to tell you.
X: Don't you dare, Shelby! Give up that greasy gossip!
X: Word on the street is, Finn's been hanging with a new lady.
X: Who the honk is it?
X: I don't...
X: Muscle Princess. It's perfect.
X: I don't...
X: Me-Mow, from the future!
X: Nobody knows. Finn's been keeping this on the super DL.
X: Why?
X: He's just trying to be careful this time.
X: Oh yeah, I get it. But I still got to know who this girl is.
X: Okay, just don't blow up his spot.
X: I won't!
X: Hey, Jake.
X: Oh hey, Science Cat. Where's Sword Shark?
X: He died of old age. Hey, are you gonna find out who Finn's girlfriend is?
X: Who told you that?
X: Word gets around, man.
X: Not to me, apparently.
X: Let me know the dirt when you find out.
X: I won't!
X: Huh? What's that? Sounds like a flute coming from above the canopy.
X: Huntress Wizard!
X: Stop!
X: This isn't working, Finn.
X: Dude.
X: Oh, hi, Jake. What are you doing here?
X: I wanted to check out your new lady friend, but I guess she just dumped you like a diaper in the dirt, bro. I'm sorry, man! I want you to have a healthy relationship with someone cool.
X: That's so sweet, Jake. I love you, man.
X: Me, too, man. Okay, I'm okay.
X: But, dude, me and Huntress Wizard weren't together. We're just trying to conjure up the Spirit of the Forest with my flute spell.
X: What the blood are you talking about?
X: It went down like this.
X: I was just minding my own business, in my new alone place I've been hanging out at.
X: Hello.
X: How are you playing like that?
X: I don't know. I'm just making stuff up.
X: Something in your notes has the quality of a powerful evocation spell. What spirit guides your hands? Tell me, or I'll put this up your nose.
X: First off, I'm a great fighter. And especially agile when I'm nude, so good luck. Second, my flute improv ain't no secret. I let my grass hand do whatever it wants, which is usually sort of shreddy and busy.
X: Let me see that hand!
X: You're what I've been looking for.
X: Looking for a dope boyfriend.
X: No man. She thinks my grass arm flute playing could summon the Spirit of the Forest. I've been playing different songs for 2 weeks, though, and he hasn't shown up yet.
X: Who's that, her ex-boyfriend?
X: Uh, I guess they used to hang out, but maybe in some kind of mentor-student capacity.
X: So my theory holds. You can still make this happen.
X: Yeah, I really want to help her summon this dude.
X: Finn, that's not why you're here.
X: That's why I'm here.
X: Come on. Let's make some magic happen.
X: Yeah, my magic flute spell.
X: Finn. I had an idea.
X: Hi.
X: I think the problem is your flute. We should make you a better one from a magical tusk, like the tusk of the legendary Thunder Boar that lives in these woods.
X: I'm down for whatever if it helps.
X: I'm also here.
X: Hey, what's up? It's late. Why don't you guys crash at my place tonight? We'll start the hunt first thing in the morning.
X: Ha-ha! I'm like your sleepover chaperone.
X: Grow up.
X: You grow up, you teen.
X: So, yeah, here's the place. We got some nice soft dirt right over here. Pantry, in case you want a snack, bathroom. I got a console if you get bored, but it was a gift, but it was a gift, so I haven't really set it up yet. Night, boys.
X: Dude, I think I figured it out. You can't summon the Spirit of the Forest 'cause you ain't playing that flute for him. You got a crush on HW.
X: HW's just training me to live an ascetic life like her.
X: Okay, I buy that for like zero seconds.
X: Before we hunt the Thunder Boar, you should drink from this enchanted spring. It might give you crazy dreams, but when you wake up, you'll be immune to the Boar's electrical attacks.
X: Let's roll those dice.
X: Hey, dude, are you sure you wanna do that?
X: I've had plenty of weird dreams... Oh-okay! That was fast.
X: Welcome. I am the Spirit of the Forest.
X: Wow, dude, we've been trying to summon you for weeks.
X: And why do you seek me?
X: I don't, personally, but Huntress Wizard really wants to talk to you, man.
X: Did you know that a wolf's eyes are on the front of its head?
X: But, yeah, didn't you guys used to hang?
X: Most predatory species are like that. This little buddy doesn't even know I'm here.
X: Fella, I don't want to have a science talk right now.
X: Huntress Wizard only sees straight ahead, eyes on the prize. Now, why did you really need to see me?
X: Oh, yeah! Can you make me immune to electricity?
X: Here.
X: Whoa.
X: Now plunge that into your heart.
X: And this will give me immunity to electricity?
X: I'll do it. To help Huntress Wizard.
X: How long was I out?
X: Seven long harrowing seconds.
X: Hold still.
X: Yeah, fells fine.
X: Great. Now we can hunt down the Thunder Boar.
X: Oh, yeah, the Boar.
X: Try to stay focused.
X: Magic dog, what do you smell?
X: Mostly, Finn, but also some kind of giant wild pig.
X: There!
X: Jake's joking. I smell fine.
X: Good work.
X: You just wanted a tusk? You could have asked!
X: Oh.
X: You can stop. He is not coming. He is gone for good, and I should just deal.
X: Maybe if I played it a little jazzier, like, all syncopated?
X: Hey! Why don't you tow try playing together? Use that chemistry to guide the music. Yeah, just get in there. Cozy up.
X: I guess we've tried everything else.
X: Wow...
X: Who summons me with the sweet song of longing? Oh, hey-oh. Can you see me now?
X: Yes.
X: How's it been going?
X: I've been talking to a lot of twigs. Where have you been, dude?
X: I've been right here, but the forces that drew us close became obscured as you drifted into the lifestyles of magic city livin'. Attracting forces come and go. It's the way of the world.
X: I still can't tell if you guys dated.
X: But I'm ready to come back now.
X: Are you, though?
X: That's what I'm saying.
X: Finn, who was your flute spell for?
X: Um... I was playing my flute for you the whole time, but I knew you had a thing with this dude, and he seems cool, so I was just gonna keep playing this flute song about my secret feelings until my flute broke.
X: I-uh, I worry that hard meat don't get eat. That is to say, if I ever find what I'm looking for, I'll become soft and I'll cease to matter in this world.
X: What?
X: Fear of softness is waht drove me to the mad and sad world of wizarding. And Finn...
X: Yeah, what?
X: My flute spell was for you, too. You're an exceptional beast, and you have great hair. But exceptional beasts like us cannot fall in love. That is the secret of ordinary people.
X: Uh, that's real dumb.
X: I agree.
X: Wait, you agree with me or her?
X: Take it easy, Huntress Wizard.
X: Man, I can't believe all you can do is upgrade your armor in this game.
X: It's all about patience and treating each grueling repetitive battle as if it were your first.
X: Oh, snap! Finally!
X: Whoo! Blah!
X: What a bad and boring game. It was just what I needed.
X: I'm sorry it didn't work out with Huntress Wizard. She just needs time to miss how cool you are.
X: Attracting forces come and go, man.


=== S8E2 ===
X: Hmm. 'Make more friends with sing-talking.' ♪ ♪ Hey there, Finn! Whatcha reading? ♪ ♪
X: It's a manuscript about "The Legend of Dead Mountain." Supposedly, if you get to the top, there's a treasure that will change you into the person you always wanted to be.
X: Ha, that's a dumb story; I love dumb stories! What would you change about yourself if you got that treasure? Fix your weird cursed grass arm so it wouldn't be weird and cursed?
X: Nah. I'd like to be taller.
X: How tall we talking about?
X: I don't know. Like, couple of inches. Say...tall as Princess Bubblegum?
X: Oh, I see.
X: Jake, how would you change yourself on Dead Mountain if only the legends were true?
X: Whoa!
X: 'Don't let him look at you or something horrible will happen.' That seals the deal. The twin temptations of getting to grow a couple of inches and battling an evil hermit sound like a pretty perfect day. Let's go!
X: Shh!
X: Let's go.
X: Gear up for battle! You smell like cattle! Gear up for battle! You smell... Like cattle!
X: Monsters that get you by looking at you are so doomb.
X: Everybody knows all you need is a mirror.
X: They ought to get a new gimmick. There's the evil hermit's uh... what is that? A hut?
X: No, it's a yurt.
X: Yah! Rats!
X: We don't get to fight the hermit.
X: Hey look.
X: What is it, boy?
X: The treasure. Okay, here it goes. Oh great treasure, make my taste buds think they're tasting fried chicken even when I eat my fruits and vegetables. I don't have any fruits or vegetables on me. I guess I'll find out later if that worked. Your turn.
X: This place is depressing.
X: And I'm not growing taller. There's nothing going on here. ON TOP OF DEAD MOUNTAIN!
X: We should have known better than to trust a book.
X: Yeah. He makes one cool skeleton, though. Aah! Ohh!
X: Finn!
X: Huh? Jake?
X: You're awake! Oh, I was so worried. I've been waiting with a bowl of soup. It has hoops and loops and maybe some goop.
X: What happened? I don't remember getting into bed.
X: Don't worry. You're gonna be fine... in no time.
X: Thanks for taking care of me. You're the greatest big brother ever. W-Why are you doing that?
X: I'm not.
BMO: You're awake! You want some tea? Or saltine crackers?
X: BMO, you're my little angel.
BMO: I'm a real boy! Oh!
X: What's happening?
X: I don't know but it probably has something to do with your weird old eyes.
X: Something is wrong with my eyes?
X: Aah! Hermit eyes! Dead-hermit eyes!
X: Heh, it's fine.
X: Do you think the hermit did this... to punish me for grabbing his shades?
X: I think maybe the eyes are the treasure.
X: So, then, am I making people what they want to be?
X: No, because I don't want to be this awesome sweater bro. But maybe that's how you see me.
X: Hey dudes. Nice eyes, Finn. What's the word? What's the haps? What's your major?
X: Whoa! Do you see Shelby as a bookish nerd?
X: You're a nerd.
X: I don't know, maybe. Is that bad?
X: Hello? ... Hiya, P.B. What's up? ... You need help with your speech? ... An emergency?! ... On our way. Let's roll, varsity Jake.
X: Ah ah. Before we go... Until you figure out how to use them, keep those peepers covered.
X: What to wear for my speech... Boss next door or hot president?
X: Is this what you needed help with?
X: No, I think I got this. Oh! Hi Finn and Jake. You guys look...cool. You trying out a new look? that.
X: Help Starchy set up chairs?
X: No no no. That.
X: Oh boy. We're on it, princess.
X: It's probably nothing. He's been good lately, but it's a big speech, you know.
X: Ohh. Ah.
X: Hey Ice King!
X: Aah! I'm not doing anything wrong. I was just lady-watching. Ow!
X: Oh no.
X: Where'd my muscles go?! I'm a scrawny-armed loser!
X: That's how you see him? That's beautiful.
X: Sure, I-I mean it's... It's hard not to sometimes. Where'd those glasses go?
X: There.
X: Starchy! Give those back, you thief!
X: Huh? No way! Starchy looks good!
X: Starchy, you butt!
X: Ohh!
X: Oof, sorry.
X: What's going on here? Can you explain this?
X: I don't know. I'm not a psychiatrist!
X: Come on, let's get you home, dude. Peebs, good luck with the speech.
X: But... Teen boy heartthrob it is.
X: Okay, at least now we're safe from you donking up any more of our friends.
X: Nobody got hurt.
X: Have any of you guys seen BMO?
X: Aah! Did I kill Neptr?!
X: You turned him into a microwave. So...yeah, you kind of did.
X: But... but... but... That's not how I see Neptr, is it? I like Neptr. He's like my half-son. If I was a better person, would I be turning my friends into better things? Am I uncaring, judgmental...
X: Uh, Finn.
X: Self-centered? Monstrous? I'm... I'm... I'm a huge wa-a-a-a-a-d!
X: Finn! You're being melodramatic!
X: I know it's you.
X: Hey, buddy. I figured you'd come back here.
X: Don't look at me, Jake. I might turn you into a microwave.
X: you're not a bad dude like this skeleton bro, or you'd be turning everyone into rats and plops. Now come on. Look at me.
X: Jake, you're so wise.
X: What?! Di- Wha... Well, at least you're listening to me. And wise old Jakey got a plan. P.B., you want to go first?
X: He may not be the most cunning soldier, but one thing about Finn is that he always puts other people first, and that makes him a true hero.
X: Finn helped Starchy fart once.
X: What a life saver.
X: Finn's a mean old party pooper. Ow! But he is the hottest guy in Ooo, so he can kind of do what he wants.
X: Finn's just the best guy to do bro stuff with, like lying on the grass and talking to bugs or baking chocolate chip cookies. Finn's just a good friend.
X: I'm me again. These balls are going nuts. Uh... My son.
X: Eye pie!
X: Ew.
X: Good job, Neptr. You saved the day. Neptr! Neptr!
X: Neptr! Neptr! Neptr! Neptr! Yay!
BMO: I just had the most wonderful dream.


=== S8E3 ===
X: Eww! The sea lard’s in my bed again. Gross.
X: Dude. That’s like the 8th time. Why don’t you just get rid of it?
X: I don’t know what’s gotten into it lately.
X: It's gross as butts, man. We’re taking care of this right now.
X: I can’t believe we never thought of this before. The pond is the perfect place for a sea lard.
X: See ya larder!
X: Huh.
X: Is he, like, okay?
X: Well, seeing as sea lards are saltwater fish, and the pond is a freshwater environment… ...no? He’s a stenohaline fish. Haven’t you guys ever heard of osmoregulation? Allow me to explain.
X: Waaaa!
X: Sorry Shelby. Gotta save the lard.
X: Thar!
X: Wa?
X: ♫♪♪Smash the frogs, smash the frogs, making frog hot dogs, smash the frogs…..♫♪♪
X: Whoa!
X: Yo! Finn and Jake are here!
X: ♫♪♪Smash the frog - Hi!
X: So, this is where you guys live?
X: Yeah!
X: We’re the guardians of this grotto.
X: You guys want to stay for lunch? We’re making hot dogs!
X: Hot dogs?!?!
X: Oh, wait. We dropped our sea lard in the pond, and we’ve got to save it before it dies from the freshwater. He’s a stenohaline fish.
X: You do know sea lards are mammals, right?
X: I’m gonna murder Shelby.
X: Well, hey, you guys should stick around. I’m gonna go finish cooking.
X: And we gotta mash more frogs.
X: I can’t believe I just believe Shelby ‘cause he’s a nerd.
X: Dude, it's the lard!
X: Hey, get away from there!
X: Bad lard! Lard!!
X: Don’t go near there! It’s too dangerous!
X: Got to save this dang lard!
X: Whatever you do, don’t touch the purple stuff!
X: WHOOAH!
X: What did she say? Don’t touch the purple?
X: What happened to the pond?
X: And how ‘bout our treehouse? The house part’s a-gone!
X: What the butt?
X: I guess we went through some portal to the past or some biz.
X: Was stuff the wrong color in the past?
X: It's weird as carbs here.

X: Oh, I know! I just like to write sad songs.
X: Wait. Hey, Jake, what were we just doing?
X: You guys are writing this down, right?
X: Why does the lard keep running away? We're trying to get it home.
X: Yeah, this place ain't safe.
X: ♫♪♪bum-bum-bum, little purple, you're a catch, I love your pretty purple sash. We're a perfect purple match, Welcome to my purple patch♫♪♪!
X: I'm Princess Purple Patch, and this is my little special Purple. Mwah!

X: I'ma call you Purple Face! You want to come play in my purple place?
X: Don't touch the purple stuff!
X: Weren't we supposed to not do something with the purple things?

X: Yeah. Wait- what were we just doing? We were.... We were.... Who are we?
X: I don't know, man. But I like these things.
X: Fine.
X: Huh? Ja-- Ja-- Jaaauump!
X: Hello. Are you a lost dog? I am boy.
X: Uh.. maybe?
X: We are boy and dog.
X: I'm petting the ground, boy.
X: Looks like fun.
X: And it smells like toast.
X: Huh? Crying. Long nose.
X: Investigate!
X: Miss, your crying indicates you're in need of help.
X: What? Yes. I've lost my rolling pin.
X: Understood. What's your name, miss?
X: I'm Bush Boots, the little apricot anteater
X: Hugs!
X: The hugs helped my crying, but it didn't help me find my rolling pin.
X: Boy and dog will find your rolling pin. Where did you last see it?
X: It was rolling around here not too long ago.
X: Oh, there it goes!
X: Come back, you bad little rolling pin!
X: Bush Boots, lets sneak up on it.
X: Am-boosh!
X: Oh, you caught it! Wonderful!
[the next scene is at Bush Boots' home. Bush boots is struggling to hold the "rolling pin".
X: Come on, now. Just roll the dough.
X: Oh, its getting away again!
X: Ma'am, I think that rolling pin is sentient.
X: Yeah, I don't think it wants to be a rolling pin.
X: Dog, we have to save that rolling pin from this sweet lady. Where did it go?
X: Rolling pin! We want to help!
X: No more.. Slime.
X: Rolling pin trail has gone cold.
X: A bee.
X: I see.
X: A poem by me. Listen for a sound and look around.
Unless egress is sought, smiles will not be found.
X: Hmm?
X: It's a metaphor.
X: A pink pond.
X: Pink pond? Pretty!
X: Hee hee! Hello, friends!
X: The pond has a face and is talking to us.
X: Yeah.
X: Dive in.
X: I don't feel comfortable diving into a face.
X: Dog, lets go back for apricot pie.
X: Yeah, pie!
X: Gross!
X: Whoaaa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
X: And then there was like, a PB puddle, a Marceline plant, and a little bee that looked like you, BMO! You know what? We didn't save the sea lard. The sea lard saved us.
BMO: Yay, sea lard!
X: Wow, what an adventure.
X: And there was even a purple lady kind of like you, Ice King! She even sounded just like you.
X: She sounds magnificent! How'd you say you got there?
X: We didn't. Beat it, creep.
X: I'll figure it out.
X: But Simon, if you go there, you'll lose you memories.
X: What memories? I'm like a goldfish over here.
X: In what way, exactly?
X: Oh, hey Jake. Where am I?
X: Comfy, dude? I bet you ran away 'cause we didn't appreciate you and called you gross and stuff. But you're not gross. Mwah! Goodnight, sea lard.

X: Everything's broken.
BMO: No, it's not! It's still good. Five seconds rule.
X: I don't know what to do.

X: Yeah, but he just keeps dropping them on the ground, and we're all like, "It's still good. Look."
X: Well, yeah, five-second rule. Jake, I think it's time for you to activate plan C.
X: Plan C? Are you sure?
X: Yes. He's all jefferied up in the dome piece. We can't let it spread any further.
X: You're right.
X: Plan C, activate. Plan C, plan C,... Aha. Bingo. Hmm.
X: Hello?
X: What's plan C, again? Something about music?
X: Poor Finn Sword. I'm sorry, man. What the heck is that? It's gonna distract me from my sword staring. Better track down the source and kill it.
X: ♪I'm gonna fly, fly like an eagle. With the power of myself, constant pain. I'm gonna climb, every mountain. Get the dust off my shelf, ohh...♪ oh, hold on, hold on, can susan get more bass in the monitor?

X: In the heat of the sun you burn like a pink little baby!

X: Oh, a scream!

X: Out of my way, muffin man!
X: How rude! Well, whatever that little girl saw will be a mystery forever.
X: Transport for seeker X-J-77 Strong has arrived.
X: Oh, trust me, I’m strong indeed. Pow, pow!
X: Eh? Not enough? You need to feel them guns?

X: Hey, Jake, what about this one?
X: Great. We’re gonna look so great for this funeral.

X: Settlement detected. Continuing search for X-J-77.

X: Hostile cylinders detected. Release countermeasures.
X: Hostile cylinders immobilized.
X: Engaging hostile bobbleheads.
X: Neutralizing. Please do not turn your system off during neutralization.
X: Holy mud! It took out the Gumball Guards like they was nothin’!
BMO: BMO doesn’t like it!

X: Got it! Great work distracting ‘em, Finn.
X: You okay, dude?
X: I feel like that ship might’ve been important, but I’m fine.
X: Yeah, my hands are a little sore from smashing, but I’m fine too.
BMO: Hiyah!
BMO: Ha ha! Once again, BMO comes out on top.
X: BMO!
X: BMO, you okay?
BMO: Signal received. XJ-7-7 requests transport.
X: Hey.
X: Hi, Finn.
X: Uh, sorry again my grass arm busted you up.
X: It’s okay. At the time, Susan was gonna bust you up. Where’s Jake? Is he okay?
X: He’s outside. He’s bringing the ship over.
X: The ship?
X: Oh, ship.
X: How ‘bout it, Suze? Does any of this look familiar?
X: Me and Finn took this whole bad block down ourselves! Took a bit of fananglin’, but I never hunt what I can’t catch.
X: Hey. Looking for this?
X: I’ve been holding onto the remnants of your cranial implant since you kidnapped Finn and almost killed Jake. You remember that? I’m running a comparative mass spec test now.
X: Yep. Looks like both your implant and the ship have the same technological origin. Human technology.
BMO: Finished!
X: Looks like BMO’s finally downloaded the ship’s last commands.
BMO: Signal received. Proceed to extraction point. Return seeker XJ-7-7 and cargo to Founders Island, Home.
X: BMO, can you give us printouts?
BMO: Yes, okay. Printing.
X: Hmm. Man, this island’s way far out there.
X: Susan needs to go back here. To this island. Not sure why. Susan having crazy week.
X: I don’t know, Susan. It’s so far. Even I don’t know what’s out there. It’s a pretty risky solo mission.
X: I’m going too. I mean, we gotta find out where this ship came from. There could be more of them. And, if this is human-made, then there might be other humans on that island. That’d be cool to see, right?
X: I’ll come too!
BMO: And so will we!
X: No, we won’t.
BMO: Oh.
X: Well, it sounds like you’re all determined. You should borrow my boat, though. This thing is trashed.
X: We don’t need a boat! Have you forgotten? With a little imagination…
X: ...I can be anything that you could ever...
X: ...Oh, I lost focus. Hey, yeah, can we borrow your boat?
X: Are you up here, Fern?
X: Hey. Thanks for letting me crash on the roof.
X: It’s nice up here.
X: Stay as long as you want. I came up here to ask a favor. I might be gone for a while on this trip, see, and I need someone to, uh, cover for me here in Ooo.
X: Are you sure? I mean, hero biz is your whole thing. And, whatever I am, I’m not you.
X: You can just do your own thing with it. Like, if some huge gross monster’s gonna do murder on a buncha innocents, uh, kill it! But kill it you-styles. Just don’t go nuts.
X: Okay, I can handle that.
X: Thanks for trusting me.
X: No, thank you, Fern. I better go pack.
X: Uh… We should figure out a better thing.
X: Let’s figure out something better.
X: Hey… Dad.
X: Charlie, hi. It’s me! It’s dad.
X: I have to go on a sea voyage, honey. I wanted to say bye.
X: That’s cool. Hey, you can’t see this shirt, right? This shirt has like, four different breakfasts on it.
X: I can’t hear anything. Bye, love you! Mwah!
X: Mkay, dad. I’ll tell the other pups.
X: And, I’m telling the other pups!
X: Aw, I’m gonna miss you so much, lady.
X: 아우 너무 걱정하지 말고 그냥 가서 좋은 형님 노릇하고와. 그리고 올때 기념품이나 사오고. ("Don't worry too much, just go and be a good brother. And when I come, I'll buy souvenirs.")
X: Finn, did you bring your nail clippers?
X: Uh, I think so.
X: Cool, I forgot too.
X: Bye, treehouse!
X: Goodbye, creator!
X: Now me and BMO can really cut loose.
X: Look, BMO! I am pretending to trash a hotel room.
X: BMO?
BMO: Ouch.
X: Thanks for seeing us off, guys.
X: Yeah, of course. It’s my boat.
X: And we care about him, you dingus! Come on! Sorry, Marcy is up past her bedtime.
X: No, it’s true.
X: I want you to be really careful out there.
X: Don’t worry. We’ve got Susan.
X: That’s not what I mean. Finn, I get the sense that this trip’s more important to you than you’re letting on. I mean, if you make it to that island, you might find out some pretty heavy stuff. About the humans and where you came from. About yourself. All I’m saying is, you have to promise me, promise me, that you’ll come home safe.
X: I-
X: Hi Bonnie!
X: Ah!
X: I’m Fern. I kind of already know you.
X: I have a lot of fuzzy half-memories from when I was this guy.
X: Well, just keep the ones where she’s our boss, and forget everything else.
X: Finn?
X: Hey! Good morning.
X: Boat’s loaded, ready to go.
X: Ah! I flinched.
X: It’s cool.
X: We’ll be back soon, I promise!
X: Bye, kids! Don’t be naughty.
X: Bye! Good luck! He’ll be safe.
X: Hey, aren’t you that dude that totaled Starchy’s motorcycle?


=== S9E2 ===
X: Heck yeah! We’re home.
X: That was definitely the longest adventure we’ve ever done.
X: What about when you got trapped in a mind dungeon for a buncha years?
X: This trip was longer in emotional time.
X: Yeah, I’m burnt out. No more adventure for a while, okay?
X: Yes, yes, yes!
X: Let’s go take hot showers!
X: Hey, look at this fish.
X: It’s… gummy?
X: Hello!
X: Hey!
X: Well, that’s weird. We should defs check it out after we hit up the tree house.
X: Yeah. We gotta get to the bottom of this hot shower.
X: Hmm. Does everything seem pinker to you?
X: Home always looks different after a long trip. You’re seeing it with fresh eyes and newfound wisdom. And sometimes there’s also a new strip mall or something. So, everything being pink is probably not a big deal, and also, I’m tired.
BMO: I like the pink. Why you worry so much, worry baby?
X: Haha, yeah, why you worry so much, worry baby?
BMO: Don’t worry, Finn. We are only teasing you because you are a baby.
X: Woah!
X: What the heck happened to the tree house?
X: Candy… Fern?
X: Oh, I do not like this.
BMO: Is this some kind of sick joke? Because I love it.
X: Huh? Big Baby Root Beer? No one buys this brand. It’s too sweet.
X: Hello?
X: Ah!
X: Hey! You look like me.
X: Fern?
X: Who’s Fern? I’m Fun the human!
X: And I’m Nectr, the little robot!
X: And I’m Shelby the worm… the gummy worm!
X: Welcome, strangers! It’s so cool that you’re inside our house.
X: Dude, when did you guys turn into candy?
X: We’ve always been candy, you silly billy bean!
X: Oh, okay, I get it.
X: We’ve obviously stumbled into another alternate dimension where everyone’s a different version of themselves. Yawn.
BMO: But we haven’t gone through any portals. BMO would know.
X: Hello!
BMO: Neptr is so cute now! I’m going to start treating him as an equal.
X: You were supposed to take care of Ooo while I was gone. What happened with that?
X: What?
X: You used to be this volatile plant boy, remember?
X: Really? Well, I’m candy now. And, I’m in control of my emotions.
X: I’m in control, too. Of my body!
X: Wow, gummy Shelby’s a lot of fun. I think I’m okay with candy world.
X: No way. Let’s talk to P.B. I’m sure this is all one of her experiments gone wrong.
X: You seem upset, friend. The tower will fix you right up.
X: The what, now?
X: Oh, boy! Let’s run outside!
X: Hello, it’s me!
X: Lemonpink!
X: He was inside the lemon.
X: Drink up, babies! Squeeze!
X: I used to have a lot of fear and sadness, but now I’m fine!
X: Hey, I want some of that!
X: No. That is body juice.
X: Hmm? What’s that? Did you spurn my fluids?
X: No…?
X: Maybe someone’s feeling a little sour!
X: Wuh-woah!
X: You know what sours get!
X: Sours get the tower!
X: Sours get the tower! Sours get the tower!
X: Sours get the tower! Sours get the tower!
X: Come on, Jake. Let’s go see Bubblegum.
X: Stop striding! It just keeps you agitated.
X: I’m freaking out, Jake. This place is weird.
X: What I’m hearing is, you’re stressed out because everything’s candy.
X: Aren’t you?
X: Not really.
X: Lemongrab’s always been a weirdo. At least now he’s helping people.
X: And Fern is, like, laughing and joking around. Maybe they don’t need you to fix them.
X: Hmm.
X: I always believe you when you use that voice.
X: Sweet P.?
X: Hey, buddy. What are you doing out-
X: -Hey! You’re meat!
X: Yes, I’m meat. But everything else is weird.
X: Wow, Sweet P., that’s almost exactly what I’ve been saying.
X: Sweet P., do you remember what happened?
X: One day, the candy came and turned mommy and daddy into something… different.
X: Sweet P.!
X: We’ve been looking for you everywhere!
X: We just love you so much, son. You’re gonna get into a great college!
BMO: They look so happy, like dogs.
X: Don’t worry, Sweet P. We’re headed to the candy kingdom to see Princess Bubblegum about all this.
X: She’s not in the candy kingdom. She’s in the terrible tower. Look!
X: Come on, Jake, that’s kind of weird, right?
BMO: I think it’s magnificent!
X: Sweet P.! Yoo hoo!
X: We brought some rollers and a bucket of sweet juicy caramel.
X: Let’s get you back to normal.
X: But mama, I am normal!
X: Just sit tight there like a windowpane, and you’ll be back to normal like a windowpane.
X: Back to normal.
X: Hmm. Okay, you’re right. This is pretty freaky-deaky.
X: I’m gonna go now.
X: Sweet P., come back!
X: Uh… Let’s get to the tower.
X: And never be the guy with no phone, Finn. You’ll think it’ll make people wanna talk to you more, but people just forget to invite you to things.
X: You’ve convinced me. Plus, I like late night bedtime calls when you’re sleeping over at Lady’s.
X: Ooh. Something smells nice. Nice and toasty.
X: S’more!
X: Stay back, s’more!
X: Get it, get it, get it, get it!
X: Woah, dudes.
X: I was just playin’.
X: What? Marceline?
X: No, it’s Marshmaline, the Campfire Queen.
X: Would you like to hear a song? I’ve written just the ditty that’ll cheer up anyone that’s overwhelmed with work or responsibility.
BMO: Yay! I love Marshmaline songs!
X: No time for tunes. Do you know where Bonnie is?
X: Of course! Follow me.
X: Marshy… Where’s P.B.?
X: She’s everywhere!
X: Good tidings to you, my friends.
BMO: Yahoo!
X: What… What happened to you?
X: Oh, this?
X: A pure candy elemental.
X: ‘Scuse me.
X: What about Tree Trunks, and Lemongrab, and Marceline, and everyone else?
X: I fixed ‘em, obviously.
X: “Fixed ‘em?” But they’re your friends!
X: Those aren’t mutually exclusive concepts.
X: That means it’s fine.
X: No. It’s not fine!
X: Don’t fret. I can fix you too.
X: I can feel my bones turning gummy!
BMO: Me, too!
X: We gotta get out of here before-
X: Hugs!
X: I’m connected to all candy throughout all the galaxies. Once you’re candy, you’ll be part of me too!
X: No! That plan sucks.
X: Oh, my gosh!
X: Ah! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!
X: I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!
X: Skyhooks!
X: Ice King?
X: Hold on to me, bro!
X: No!
X: Wait, we forgot BMO!
BMO: Goodbye, boys! It’s better this way!
X: Oh, well. They’ll be back.
X: They have nowhere else to go.
X: Are we in…
X: Cloud Kingdom.
X: Looks like we got away before the candy curse became permanent.
X: That’s right. My skyhooks saved the day.
X: Thanks for getting us out of there, Simon.
X: Aw, I can’t take all the credit. It’s all thanks to my skyhooks!
X: Hey, why are you even up here?
X: We live here, now. Me and the skyhooks.
X: Finn...You gotta see this.
X: Oh...my...
X: ...butt.
X: Skyhooks!


=== S9E10 ===
X: Hey, brother. Pass me that jam, won't you?
X: Sure.
X: Thanks.
X: So, how is your toast?
X: Pretty good. Funny, though, I can kind of taste the toast's emotions or something. Getting ground into flour and then made into bread really did a number on this wheat's sense of self.
X: That's a pretty hyper‐developed sense of taste you've got there. Hey, you seem kind of different.
X: Nope. Same old Jake.
X: You're blue, you've got those five eyes, you're way bigger, and you keep discovering strange new abilities. I think this might be a situation.
X: Where's this coming from
X: Whoops! Tuck‐tuck. See? Same old Jake.
BMO: Ahhh!
X: Whoa.
BMO: Ahhh! Jake is a crab! Ahhh!
X: Same old Jake. If you say so.
X: Hmm.
X: I think I'm handling these minor changes pretty well. Besides, a lot of people are different these days. Dirt Beer Guy, you're practically a zombie. How are you dealing with it?
X: Well, I'm basically the same as before. The difference is only physical.
X: So you agree Finn is really overreacting?
X: Totally. You're the same person as before.
X: Heck yeah! I'm still the same old Jake on the inside.
X: Wait, you're Jake?! Uh, pardon me. Oh, dear, oh, dear. That's really something.
X: You know, I think I figured out why I make people uneasy. They're used to yellow Jake.
X: Lady, that tickles.
X: 젠장! (Damn!)
X: It's okay, lady. Thanks for trying, but I'm fine, really.
X: 어떤 일이 일어나도 나는 널 사랑해. (I love you no matter what happens.)
X: I love me, too.
X: Jermaine?
X: Ahh, mountain colors. I'm painting this mountain. I think it's really coming together.
X: That's the mountain?
X: Yep. I'm a mirror. Hey, who's your friend?
X: Yipe!
X: Dad?
X: Look at this. I can almost walk the dog.
X: Your body looks like one of my paintings. Pretty weird dream, huh?
X: This isn't just a dream body, this is what my body looks like when I'm awake.
X: Oh. Got it.
X: Ha! I've got it!
X: What?
X: I can almost walk the dog.
X: Finn, you up?
X: Yeah, man.
X: I had a really bad dream last night. So ominous. These images are going to haunt me for, like, forever.
X: Sometimes it helps me if I draw a bad dream in picture form. My crayons!
X: It was a weird scene, all right. Chanting ladies, labyrinths, classical sculpture. And Jermaine was there, too. The weird thing was that he was painting abstract art.
X: So? F.Y.I., Jermaine hates abstract art. He would never paint something non‐representational.
X: Maybe he's just trying something new?
X: It's not in his nature. Why would he all of a sudden get into painting meaningless shapes?
X: He's probably fine.
X: Just feels so out of character, you know, for Jermaine.
X: How's the drawing?
X: Just squiggles.
X: Fuelish tank! You are too slow for the Finnosaurus. Give up! Give up!
X: I knew I had seen that mountain.
X: Vrrt‐vrrt‐vrrt! Brrt! Who goes there?!
X: James, it's me, Jake.
X: You look nothing like Jake, but I believe you. I just have to ask because I'm supposed to guard the Wasteland. I was just making some beans. Come to my tent!
X: Okay, but I don't want any beans.
X: Man! I could eat beans all day, every day.
X: Where did you get that painting?
X: One day when I was guarding, I saw Jermaine painting it. James was like, "Dang, I like that painting!" And he was like,"You can have it." And I was like, "Waah?"
X: You like this? It doesn't look anything like a mountain.
X: I think you're looking at it wrong.
X: Where'd Jermaine go...after?
X: He went back to his studio, behind the wall of water.
X: You mean a waterfall?
X: No, like the thing I said.
X: Hey! None but the chosen may walk beyond the wall of water.
X: What have you done with my brother?
X: Who's your brother?
X: Jermaine.
X: Wow. You guys don't look anything alike.
X: We're practically twins.
X: Well, I guess you can walk beyond the wall of water. But just this once. Ooooh!
X: Can I help you, sir?
X: Hey, Bryce. I'm looking for Jermaine. Is he behind that door marked "private"?
X: No, no, no. Mr. Jermaine won't be seeing anyone today. His wishes for privacy were quite explicit. You wouldn't want to interrupt Mr. Jermaine. He's a brilliant painter.
X: Yeah, he used to be. Now you got him painting all this nonsense.
X: I'm just his humble dealer. So many times I've watched him painting, painting, painting.
X: What's really going on, Bryce? My dad told me all about your demon tricks.
X: Well, now I don't want to say anything bad about your dad, but...
X: Bro? I'm here to save you.
X: Hmm? Oh, hey. I'm not sure if this is done yet. It's hard to tell when an abstract is finished.
X: Jermaine, what's wrong with you? Who's taken away your identity as a landscape painter?
X: There's nothing wrong with me, Jake. I just changed a little. You seem like you've changed a little bit, too.
X: No, I just look different.
X: Eh, that sounds like denial.
X: No, it doesn't!
X: Come on, bro.
X: Nothing's different! I'm the same! Same old Jake! Completely...normal!
X: This looks bad, but deep down,I'm not different. And you're not different either, right? You'll go back to painting landscapes?
X: No one is making me do this. I painted so many landscapes that the shapes of the land began to lose their meaning. And the shapes broke apart to me, so I painted them like that. And it's not like my new paintings erase my old paintings. They're both me. Okay. I think I'm starting to get it. I like the new look, by the way.
X: 'Cause you like your brothers to be crazy shapes?
X: Sure. Also, Dad told me you might go through some changes one day.
X: Huh?
X: He told me to be supportive. But I would've done that anyway.
X: I wonder what he meant.
X: You knowhow secretive Dad was. Sorry I don't have more answers.
X: Well, do you have any more of these paintings?
X: The shapes are always changing. Changing is their normal state, like us. Even if we're not changing on the outside, we're changing on the inside constantly. There's some stuff about me that I've been ignoring for a long time. I'm afraid of that stuff. But it's part of who I am. As long as I know the shape of my soul, I'll be alright.
X: Wow. You really understand my art.
X: Oh, I totally don't understand anything.
X: Hey, you're back.
X: Yeah, I went to see Jermaine. He says hi.
X: No, I mean, like,you're really back.
X: Huh?
X: Different, yet the same.


=== S9E12 ===
X: These ghoul dudes take the form of whatever you're thinking about.
BMO: An angry -- no, shy shark baby.
X: What if life was always just constant fun times on the river?
X: Let's never do anything boring ever again.
BMO: Yes, let's never do anything boring ever ag-- Time for Ice King's boring book reading.
X: Aw, come on! He's just gonna read those weird stories that are basically about us.
X: I kind of dig getting loosely adapted.
X: Fionna spoke with the voice of an angelic choir. "You can have the rest of the screaming chili cheese dip if you want," she said. "It's totally fine." The end.
X: I said "the end"!
X: Let's get some questions.
X: Where do your ideas come from?
X: They're beamed into my melon at night - same as everybody else. Next!
X: I have more of a criticism than a question.
X: I am very open to criticism!
X: Your story was completely wrong.
X: And how would you know?
X: I know... because I am... Fionna!
X: I can show you what really happened. It's all on this tape!
X: Ooh!
X: What format is that?
X: According to this map, we're very close. There's the door.
X: Aw, it's locked.
X: I'll get us in with key... eye!
X: Bam! "Eye" got it. You get it, Fionna?
X: Yeah, but it's a stretch.
X: There I am.
X: Next time we find a map lying in the backyard, we should think twice.
X: At least we get this fancy coffin.
X: How's it look?
X: It's a decent addition to the treasure vestibule but still kind of a letdown.
X: You know what's never a letdown? Cookie sauce review party.
X: Yeah! Cookie dip. Screaming chili cheese versus sriracha ranch.
X: Was it real?
X: Who was filming all that?
X: Wenk, wenk.
BMO: Needs more hunks!
X: Dude, I literally have one bazillion questions. Uh, excuse me, Miss Fionna... Where did this video come fr-o-o-m!
X: Fionna! I always knew we'd meet one day and become best friends. So, uh, remember that time when Cake caught Ruse Goose, the notorious goose pickpocket?
X: That was such a long time ago.
X: But during trial, you realized she was framed 'cause it was actually Abracadanielle pretending to be a goose all along!
X: Can I also ask a question?
X: Besties only.
X: I was just gonna ask if we could see more of the tape.
X: Oh, yeah, can we?
X: I don't think so.
X: All right, just a little more.
X: Oh... my... glob. It's a mummy!
X: That's right. I'm a mummy!
X: Aww.
X: Yeah, you are. And a real cutie, too.
X: I'm not cute! I'm horrible!
X: Wanna hang?
X: Okay, that's enough.
X: Aw!
X: I want to see more.
X: I don't want to wear it out. It's my only copy. And it's very important to me.
X: Library closes in five. Click, click, click.
X: So, where you heading now?
X: Guess I'll go back to the dump under the bridge where I live. I'd invite you over, but I don't have a sofa or TV or anything. It's literally a dump.
X: I have a TV. My crib is equipped.
X: Oh, really?
X: Hey, you should move in! Please live with me, Fionna.
X: This is the sweet spot. My roo-- Not that you mind a bit of dirt, right?
"Fionna" admires a poster on the wall which reads "Fionna & Cake and the Haunted Baguette 2".
X: Nice, huh?
X: So, this is my room now.
X: Only the best for Fionna.
X: Oh yeah, I like this room too. It's where I do all my deep thinking. Man, I still can't believe it-- the Fionna in my bathroom, touching my toothbrush, throwing it into my little trash can. Fionna taking charge!
X: That's what heroes do.
X: You're a so much better hero than Finn.
X: I know.
X: Plus, don't tell Jake, but I've always been more of a cat person. Where is Cake the Cat? Cake? Cake?
X: Cake is gone. Some years back, there was an adventure mishap. I don't feel comfortable talking about it.
X: Oh, okay.
X: Hey, you still haven't shown me where you keep your Fionna and Cake tapes.
X: Sorry, no can do.
X: What? Don't you have tapes?
X: Oh, yeah, I got loads of tapes, but they're super private.
X: Maybe you'll change your mind once you see more of my mummy adventure?
X: Yay! I'll get snacks.
X: Hey, what's wrong?
X: I have... a curse!
X: Oh no.
X: How can we save you, tiny mummy?
X: The curse can only be broken by strong black coffee and fancy muffins from Breakfast Kingdom.
X: I know that place. It has a really long line on weekends.
X: Yes! That sounds like the one. Be a hero and fetch unto me the sacred breakfast.
X: Don't you worry, little guy.
X: We'll save you!
X: Okay, that's the end of the tape.
X: Really? My stories usually get wrapped up neater. Wrapped up -- mummies.
X: Yeah, well, there's no more, so... You wouldn't know this, but old heroes need a lot of sleep.
X: I did know that.
X: See you in the morning.
X: Okay.
X: Fionna? You awake? I made you a midnight snack.
X: Mummy, we're home.
X: I knew it.
X: Where did it go?
X: Maybe it had to go back into its coffin Dracula-style.
X: Mummy?
X: We got you breakfast.
X: Hmm.
X: Shh! What's that?
X: Nyeh!
X: That's our treasure!
X: Stay away. You'll get cursed.
X: I take the curse off of me and put it back on you.
X: You understand nothing of mummy curses!
X: Our treasure!
X: Our muffins!
X: Uhh... Do not look upon a naked mummy. It's bad luck.
X: Queen of Ooo?!
X: That's right. I snuck in here to pretend to steal your stash and teach you a valuable lesson. Never invite strangers into your home, no matter how cool they seem and are. You should be thanking me really.
X: Of course. She didn't want me to see the end of the tape because she's not Fionna. She's... a mummy! Aah!
X: Come on. They're all just him?
X: Imposter! Reveal yourself!
X: Aah! Knock it off!
X: You're the knock-off!
X: What?
X: You're not Fionna!
X: How did you--
X: Show me your true form!
X: Aha! Huh? What kind of mummy are you supposed to be?
X: No kind! I'm just an old lady.
X: Who likes to dress up as Fionna?
X: It makes me feel confident, okay? Plus I look really good in this outfit. Look, I used to be very shy, tinkering with my tech stuff all night, sleeping all day. But one evening, I intercepted a strange signal. I was mesmerized. I watched that tape like a hundred times before I finally stepped out of my cave a new woman, determined to find more Fionna and Cake. I roamed Ooo for years with no luck. But then I found out about you, and I hatched a plan to steal your tapes.
X: What? I don't have any Fionna and Cake tapes.
X: I know! All of your tapes are filled with embarrassing diaries.
X: If I met them, I'd definitely record it.
X: Fionna and Cake aren't real, you ding-dong! They're just, like, a TV show from the past or something.
X: You're the ding-dong, lady! You tricked an old, defenseless Ice King.
X: Look, I didn't mean to hurt you.
X: You lied to me. Fionna would never lie -- never.
X: Oh, glob, you're right. I'm not like Fionna. I'm the mummy! Oh glob!
X: Wenk.
X: Huh? Well, that was disheartening.
X: Forgive me, Fionna!
X: Cake, what time is it?
X: Wenk.


=== S9E13 ===
X: Squish.
X: Photosynthesize! Photosynthesize! Photo-
X: You grabbing a snack, Fern?
X: Yeah. Water and light combine so I can make my own food. In case I don't catch anything.
X: Come on, man, don't be so dow- Hey, I got something!
X: Hey, I got something too!
X: Nice.
X: Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
X: Pretty weird fish, huh?
X: That's me - the dude who dinks it up, just like I dinked it up when you left Ooo. I was supposed to protect it. Instead, it went all crazy. I didn't even help. I just covered myself in root beer and danced around like a dummy. I can't do anything right!
X: Hey, stop it. You need a squoze?
X: Yes.
X: I feel better.
X: Sometimes being a good dude ain't about not dinking it. Learn from your dinks. Like, you know my first battle with a giant? I never told anybody this, but-
X: You boom-boomed in your shorts. I know. I have your memories.
X: Yeah, I boom-boomed. The point is I learned from it, and now I'm Finn. You got to learn how to be Fern.
X: What's that sound?
X: Oh, I bet it's a monster. Let's fight this dude Fern's way.
X: Yeah. Fern's way.
X: Whoa!
X: Okay, Fern, what do you think we should do next?
X: Mm, sever his tendons?
X: Before you say no, it would stop him from running.
X: We're gonna handle this librarian style. Kiss. You can renew the book and bring it back next week.
X: Library style. Squo-o-oze.
X: Mm.
X: Great thinking, Fern.
X: I just copied you. Is that thinking?
X: What up, buttercup? Why you run, pork bun?
X: The monster!
X: Was it LSP?
X: The monster that whispers me bad thoughts.
X: Mommy and Daddy came to save me, but they said I was imagining things, which was true.
X: But last night, I really did see it.
X: And I've been running and running since then.
X: Aww, Sweet P. It sounds like you might just be having bad dreams.
X: No, I only have one dream anymore.
X: Uhh...
X: Uhh...
X: But the whisper monster is even scarier, saying stuff like, "Sweet P, you're bad. You always have been bad." I don't want to be bad.
X: Oh, you're not bad. You're super good. Now, let's get you home.
X: But it's getting late, and bogs are super dangerous to travel in at night. Your body will be preserved for thousands of years. No one will ever find you.
X: Fern!
X: Okay, okay, we'll see you in the morning, Tree Trunks. All right, bedtime, Sweet P.
X: You want me to knock him out?
X: Er, not this time. How about a bedtime story?
X: Yes, please.
X: Once there was a kingdom of spaghetti.
X: Mmm.
X: Punch, punch. Kiss, kiss.
X: Listen to your bones.
X: Fern.
X: Fern!
X: Hey. What's up?
X: I heard something. Can you see what it is with your tree senses?
X: I don't have those.
X: Uh, can I help you?
X: Oh, sorry. We heard you scuttling around and thought-
X: What? You didn't hear me "scuttling around." Foxes are silent hunters. I mean, geez, do you know how rude that is? Ugh. Gonna be brooding about this all week.
X: Sorry, man.
X: Look.
X: Aah! Get off him!
X: Huh?
X: I got him!
X: Oh, no. I know where I've seen that thing before.
BMO: Huh?
BMO: Finn, Jake!
X: What's shaking?
BMO: You will not believe what just happened.
X: It must've been the day that BMO found that little sailor hat. Hold him down, Fern! That hand is the flippin' Lich!
X: I know.
X: Yes, child. I have returned once more to-
X: Bah! Bah! Bah! Bah! Evil! You're gonna get it for messing with our boy Sweet P.
X: That vessel may appear harmless, but he came from me. Once I remind him of his legacy, The Lich shall reign once more. Isn't that right, son?
X: Aah!
X: Finn!
X: Ugh! I dinked it again!
X: Why did Mr. Hand call me "son"? Was that my monster daddy?
X: Okay, delegate, delegate - Fern, stay here and guard Sweet P. I'm gonna try and catch up.
X: Don't trust me to guard anything. I'm a total scrub-up.
X: You got this!
X: You got this.
X: Quickly, while the boy is gone, we must seek out my Well of Power.
X: No! Am I turning into a monster?
X: That's the working theory.
X: Hey man, hit me when you get this. Okay, Lich. Get ready to die. Again. For, like, the fifth time!
X: Oh, hey, it's this awful place.
X: Oh, you're tricky, huh?
X: I can hear you down there! Speak up, man. What?
X: You've bested me in many worlds, child, but I always return.
X: You're so evil it's boring. You're basic, man.
X: Yes. While a mortal world doubts and questions, I know exactly what I am. I am the ceaseless wheel. The last scholar of GOLB. I am your doom.
X: Skull man!
X: Huh?
X: I, too, am doom.
X: Hey, what's going on up there?
X: Child, you have failed. The vessel has turned. We reign now as twin kings of ruin.
X: Sweet P...
X: I'm not a king of ruin.
X: What?
X: I am sweet. You're just a naughty hand.
X: Beast, obey me! Obey- No!
X: Eesh.
X: Hooray!
X: You're a natural! But where's Fern?
X: He wouldn't let me follow you, so I knocked him out cold.
X: Yeah, I met my bio-dad once too. He wasn't evil incarnate, but he was kind of a crummy dude. TT and Mr. P love you. That's all that matters. Fern! Sweet P saved me and slew The Lich!
X: That's great.
X: You're just a naughty hand.
X: Beast, obey me! Obey- No!
X: End of message. To repeat this message, press 7. To save...
X: Wha...?
X: I don't get it. Why isn't it working out being myself? Finn's off having fun defeating losers. I can't even guard a baby.
X: the only Finn.
X: Uh, yeah, but that's a weird thing to call me.


=== S9E14 ===
X: Finn?
X: Yo.
X: Oh, hey. Me and BMO are heading over to the vuvuzela store in the Music Kingdom. You want to come with? I got to get a new vuvuzela. Somebody keeps smashing my old one.
BMO: I can't bear this burden any longer! It was me! I'm the vuvuzela smasher!
X: BMO, how could you?
X: No, it was me! I'm the vuvuzela smasher.
X: Neptr?!
X: No, I'm the vuvuzela smasher.
X: All right, all right. Well, I'm still getting one. You coming?
X: Nah, me and Fi- ...Fern are supposed to clean out the chicken coop today. And if anyone tries to stop me, I'll slash their flipping faces off.
X: True, true. Okay, well, I'll see you later then. Come on, BMO.
BMO: Jake, I'm sorry! I really am the smasher!
X: Ah, don't sweat it buddy.
X: Hyup! You're getting new powers like every day now. Let me see you do Jake - no, wait, Ice King! Do Ice King!
X: Ha, nah, man. Imitating uncool people infects you with their loserishness.
X: Oh. Yeah, that rings true. It's too bad you didn't develop any coop-poop-scooping skills. That coop is incredibly disgusting.
X: Actually, about that, I was thinking that, instead, maybe you and I could explore some secret ruins I found.
X: Secret ruins?! Sweet! Maybe we can still catch up with Jake and BMO! Or maybe Neptr could come! Hey, Neptr, you want to go on an adventure, buddy?!
X: Oh my glob! Hold on!
X: Actually, I was thinking maybe just you and me would go. Spend some quality time together, Finn and Fern style.
X: Yeah, okay. That actually even sounds like something Jake would want us to do. ♪ Dungeon surprise, right before my eyes, what a surprise, the dungeon surprise. ♪
X: One, two, three - shoot! Rock! One, two, three - shoot! Scissors!
X: This is so weird. I can't tell if it's boring or fun.
X: Well, I can. It's boring. I want the thrill of victory! Who wants to be the same all the time?
X: Come on, man! You know you love it! Come on! One, two, three... Come on!
X: One, two, three - shoot!
X: Rock.
X: Paper.
X: What?!
X: Whoa! I won this time.
X: What? But that's not fair! Why is nothing ever fair?
X: Hey, Fern, it's just a game. Don't be so weird.
X: Don't-! ...Don't call me that.
X: Sorry.
X: Ah, it's okay. That stuff won't mean a thing. I mean, that stuff don't mean a thing. Hey, come on, we're almost there! Whoop, whoop, whoop!
X: Hey, wait up! Whoop, whoop!
X: Whoop, whoop whoop!
X: Whoop, whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop!
X: Look, we're here!
X: Where? I just see a bunch of rock, swear to glob.
X: But check this out.
X: Whoa! Magic key!
X: I had to chop up a bunch of stubborn so-and-sos to get my hands on this baby.
X: Dang. You've been busy.
X: Wow, would you look at that! They hid this ziggurat in the cliff side. Amazing!
X: Yeah, I poked around in there a bit, but-
X: Dut, dut, dut! No spoilers!
X: No, I know. I didn't go past the first level. I was saving it to do together.
X: Sweet. Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya!
X: Come on.
X: Hey, Fern, wait up. Hey, I just want to say that it's really cool that you're into this stuff. You know - that we have so much in common. It feels almost like we're real brothers, right? Or even closer.
X: Hmm. Fascinating.
X: Oh. Uh, okay. I guess just holler if you need me. Contemporary chair, contemporary trash, contemporary meatloaf? Hey, bad news, Fern. It looks like we've got a squatter situation here.
X: I think they got the treasure, but they left some meatloaf behind. The good news is I know a meatloaf dealer-
X: What the? Fern? Uh, Fern? I think maybe the wind blew the door shut. An "act of nature", I would presume.
X: I'm sorry. I don't actually know how to make meatloaf. That's just a pan of dirt.
X: Well, that's okay. I don't know how to either! ...Fern, please open the door.
X: This is where you live now. You'll be fine.
X: What?! Fern, what about Jake and BMO - my home?
X: It's been your home long enough. It's Fern's turn. I think I'm going to be a really great Finn. Hey, do you know who my favorite is? It's Neptr. I'm a Neptr guy! I'll be back in a month with a new bucket of trash. Later!
X: Fern!? There's got to be something useful in here.
X: You'll be back in a month?! With a new bucket of trash?! It's hot! There's no air in here! I need air! I need air!
X: Wha? Uh, hello.
X: Hi, Finn! You're still asleep after your fight with Susan. But when you wake up, I'm sure you'll have fun discovering everything your new arm can do. And Finn, sincerely, thank you for defending our kingdom again. Oh. Someone else wants to thank you, too. I don't know. Okay, um... Welcome, Finn!
X: Huh.
X: Yes!
X: Huh?
X: You donked up!
X: Aah!
X: Hey!
X: What do you think you're doing?!
X: I'm weed whacking.
X: You've been Finn long enough! It's my turn.
X: Fern, smarten up!
X: Nuh-uh!
X: What are you?
X: A weed whacker.
X: My belzer!
X: Fern, if things are going down the way I think they're going down, please tell Jake I love him.
X: That doesn't matter. I love him!
X: I know you do, Fern. Listen, we can stop this and just go home together. All this lying and fighting, it doesn't have to end like this. Today doesn't have to have this kind of... finality.
X: Fatality!
X: Hey, boys! Y'all have fun out there? Wait, what happened?
X: Almost done, champ. There you go. You looking for an uncle?


=== S10E2 ===
X: Huh?
X: I was just sipping my coffee.
X: Oh.
BMO: I am also excited about today.
X: Oh, yeah?
BMO: Today is the first day of my new job.
X: What's your new job, BMO?
X: Yeah, are you a spy? You know, 'cause of the overcoat?
BMO: I'm a door-to-door salesman.
X: Oh.
X: What are you selling?
BMO: I've got so many great things. Like for the man about town, this piece of lint.
X: I'll take it!
BMO: Hooray, my first sale! That'll be four doubloons.
X: Can I pay you later?
BMO: Mm, the customer is always right!
X: Good attitude, BMO.
BMO: Well, gentlemen... got to chop that wood.
X: It's Ice King.
X: I know.
BMO: Okay, wish me luck, fellas, even though I don't need-
X: Aww.
X: Boy, this is great, huh? You and me out in the fresh air? Now, the key to being a tip-top salesman is to get the ol' foot in the door.
BMO: Bodies don't talk, Ice King.
X: Well, mine does.
BMO: Okay, then. If I say "My feet hurt," you can go "Woof woof." That's my dogs barking.
X: BMO, I think we're gonna make an unbeatable team.
BMO: Yeah, yeah! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
X: No Time For Sleeping. Elizabeth's heart was racing like a water mill after spring thaw. She knew her enemies were coming for her, but when? Suddenly, there was a knock at the door."
X: Oh! Oh. Oh, my goodness. Someone's at the door. That's all. Hello.
BMO: Tree Trunks, how are your children? Can you believe this weather?
X: So polite. Please, please come in.
BMO: You have a lovely home.
X: Here, have some apple pie.
BMO: Oh, thank you.
X: Now what can I do for you?
BMO: Oh, well, I'd like to show you what I'm selling today.
BMO: Okay, we have a broken branch, a half-eaten sandwich - oh, another ball of lint.
X: Another?
BMO: These are selling like red hots. A dust bunny - That's like a cage-free ball of lint. A doll's head, and a little velvet bag, tied tight at the top.
X: I'll take the branch. My loose cash is up there in the flower jar. Help yourself.
X: What'd you buy, honey bunch?
X: A branch.
X: Huh. Huh? Oh. Ah, Tree Trunks, you're a financial genius.
BMO: I can't believe we unloaded that branch. It wasn't even our best one. Oh, my. Shield my eyes from the sun.
X: Why?
BMO: Because I think I see our next customer. Those nuts could be ours. Excuse me, little boy!
BMO: How are your children?! Ice King, duck. Jump. Right. Right again. Left. Jump, jump. Left. Right. Left. Ice King, you're doing so good. You have not bumped into anything.
X: BMO, where's the customer?
BMO: Oh, no. I was so excited about you not bumping into anything, I lost the customer. Ice King, I think we are lost.
BMO: Look. A house.
X: All I see is the inside of this coat.
BMO: And... stop. Knock politely.
BMO: Mysterious sentinel, you have a lovely home.
BMO: Hello.
BMO: I'm a door-to-door salesman, ma'am.
X: Ouch.
BMO: I have some wonderful new products, like, uh, this ball of lint. No, wait, this is the dust bunny. Uh... Oh, oh! I know - this velvet bag.
BMO: Did I mention that it contains Finn's teeth?
X: Please, let's go in the parlor, where we can be more comfortable.
X: And you're sure these are Finn's teeth?
BMO: Yes.
X: The same Finn who serves Princess Bubblegum, obstructs my plans, and plagues my thoughts?
BMO: Yes.
X: Finn the Human's teeth?
BMO: That's a BMO guarantee.
X: Psst! Does Finn know you have his teeth? Because I don't think-
BMO: Hey! I'm trying to close a sale here.
X: I hope you accept silver. I can pay you immediately. Yes, my pretties.
X: Poor little guy. Still wearing out the shoe leather trying to make just one more lousy sale before coming home.
X: He'll feel better after we have a little party for him.
X: Still, it's tough seeing your kid get his heart set on doing something he really sucks at.
BMO: Hello, boys. Meet the salesman of the year. Or maybe of the decade. The Chinese food is on me. I mean, check out the loot.
X: It's real.
X: What the heck did you sell to get this silver goblet?
BMO: Just a line of smooth talk and pipe dreams. Oh, and a set of human baby teeth.
X: Where did you even get a set of human baby teeth? BMO!
BMO: Branches and lint are moving like cray, Jake.
BMO: Oh, sure, I sold your baby teeth. I could sell any part of you.
X: These were, like, the only things I had left from when I was a little kid.
X: Hey, you know what? We'll just go buy back those little pearly whites. I'm sure whoever bought them is like, "Why did I buy these things?" What possible use could some guy have for a set of human baby teeth? Unless he's an evil sorcerer or a mad scientist... He wasn't a mad scientist, was he?
BMO: Well...
X: They're made out of some kind of hard tooth-like material. Ouch. Ouch! Ice King, freeze these nightmare babies.
X: I'm not allowed to wear my crown. It's against BMO's dress code.
X: Just don't let them climb into your mouth!
X: Hey, there, bitey boys. Get off of there. Where's your baby manners? Eek.
BMO: Hmm. Maybe I sold too well.
X: Hey, you're a great salesman. Evil babies are not a problem for you. They're an opportunity.
BMO: Yeah. Where did I put those - Oh, here they are. Gentlemen, could I interest you in a couple of sledgehammers? Perfect for smashing through minerals or composites.
X: I'll take one.
X: Me too!
BMO: Great decision.
BMO: A little tap is all it takes.
X: These baby-smashing hammers are great.
BMO: I'm sorry I caused such a mess. It's very bad for business.
X: Well, time to call it a day. The ice man leaveth.
BMO: Hey, wait. See you tomorrow, partner.
X: Until tomorrow.
X: Yeah, you're not doing this tomorrow.
X: Hmm. In retrospect, the attack would have worked much better were they not baby teeth.

X: Rap Bear. What happened?
X: My son and I were having Sunday dinner. We were lightly rapping back and forth. It turned into a rap battle. He threw out rhyme after rhyme. I couldn't keep up.
X: You got beat by your own son? Are his rap powers that much greater than yours?
X: Yes. Why are you asking about my son?
X: Flame Princess is going up against him one on one in a freestyle battle.
X: He rapped my legs off.

X: You're not here to put me back in lantern jail, are you?

X: I know exactly what you're saying. I've totally gotten over being in lantern jail, so we're good.
X: Well, I was kind of hoping you could acknowledge hurting me, like-

=== S10E4 ===
X: Whew. A goblet of sparkling apple juice for milady.
X: Thanks, Finn. Hey where'd you get this goblet?
X: Oh, uh, I think we won it in a fight with an octopus we were fighting in, like, a sea cave full of treasure?
X: No. It was from when BMO was playing dress-up.
X: It reminds me of a cup my uncle used to have.
X: You mean your Uncle Gumbald, right?
X: Do tell. You never talk about your family.
X: I don't know. Families are tricky. You guys know what I mean, right? We have to go back a ways Like 800 years ago.
X: Help! Help me! Oh, goodness me. Someone please help me. I'm a defenseless little goblin surrounded by all this loot. Boo-hoo.
X: Oh, you poor thing, here. Have a drink to ease your nerves while I untie you.
X: Pfft! Aah! The time for faking is over now. Give me all your stuff.
X: Aah-aah-aaah!
Mm?
X: Another close call today, Neddy.
X: Neddy, you sweet chicken. It was a lot different back in the Mother Gum. We all had each other's backs. I'm going to make more of us, Neddy. I know you don't care, and that's fine. But I need to be around people like me.
X: O-kay! This is it, Neddy. We're getting relatives!
X:Your name is Aunt Lolly!
X: A pleasure to meet you, dear.
X: And you're Cousin Chicle. You're a full 2.3 meters tall.
X: Naturally I am a gentleman of high standing.
X: Oh, Cousin Chicle. And finally Uncle Gumbald! This is your favorite mug.
X: Ah, yes. I'm your GREAT uncle. The mug proclaims it so.
X: Aren't they great, Neddy? You'll be my protectors, my advisers, my family.
X: I'm heading out, Neddy. What? What? What?!
X: Morning, small niece.
X: Uncle Gumbald, the taffy trees are gone!
X: I know. I chopped 'em down last night. Yesterday, I realized these trees were not being utilized to their full potential, so I elected to build this cabin. This is but the first step in building my glorious new candy city. I've already drawn up the plans for it. All of this will be apartments. And did you notice the family crest I designed? It's a "G" for, uh "Gum".
X: Why does it look like your head?
X: You're such a curious little girl. We're a lifestyle brand now.
Scene changes to later in the night
X: Success! Now instead of worrying about his dumb city, Uncle can come here to picnic, swim, and, uh fish!
X: Welcome to life, Candyfish.
X: I can't breathe air!
X: Bonnie! What have you done to my building site?
X: I made us a butterscotch lake and a fish to live in it.
X: But that's where the gift shop was gonna go.Now it's just gonna be volleyballs, water skis, and shrimp cocktails.
X: Sounds nice.
X: Did you say you "made" this creature?
X: Come on. You'll appreciate him more once you watch him swim around.
X: Bonnibel you've micromanaged me for the last time. Huh? Hmm. I think it's time for Bonnie to be re-branded.
X: Niece, now that I've had to stare at it for weeks, I've got to admit that your lake was a very good idea.
X: Ja! Sehr gut!
X: Very wunderbar.
X: Oh, I'm so happy.
X: We got you a gift to say thanks. It's right outside, Prinzessin.
X: You got me a car?
X: Yes, a car. But also a boyfriend!
X: Hi, babe.Beep beep!
X: Wait, what?
X: All right, you nut. Have fun on your date.
X: Date?!
X: Let's go, babe. Beep beep!
X: What a naive little child.
X: Date's over, babe. Pick you up tomorrow to get matching tattoos.
X: I'm back from that terrible date. Hello?
X: Thank you for coming to the mandatory optimization meeting. Tonight, we address the "Bonnie problem".
X: Bonnie problem?
X: Our future city is on course to be a rousing success, barring only one obstacle Our complete lack of competent leadership.
BB's the leader? I thought she was a mime. Cause I never hear a word she says.
X: Oh, Cousin Chicle! Oh, Cousin Chicle!
X: Dang, Chicle, that's cold.
X: I have formulated a happy juice that will render her as docile and simple-minded as her cutie BF, young Mr.Creampuff.
X: All we have to do is sprinkle some of this on her breakfast, and we'll be in charge.Let us celebrate with coup d'etat cupcakes.
X: Poisoned cakes.
X: Where am I?
X: Oh, right, the poison.
X: I don't know what's happening! Whee! Whee! Whee! Whee!
X: Ah! My first candy employees.
X: What have you done? This isn't what I made you to be.
X: No, you wanted us to be lowly pet fish, swimming in your narcissistic pond. But I am your equal!
X: You're not like me. You're bad.
X: I am the future. Come on, Bonnie. Don't run away from happiness. I'm going to fix you. And then, I'm going to fix that sniveling gumwad, Neddy.
X: Don't touch my brother!
X: A pea-shooter? The juice! Nooooo!
X: What a mess. But they do seem happier now So unburdened and pliable. You, the crunchy ball, dance for me.
X: Sure. Come on, lady. Do the crunchy dance.
X: Oh, Crunchy. Sure, I'll dance with my candy people.
X: Yay for the lady!
X: Call me Princess.
X: Hurrah!
X: Whoa, for real?
X: Like I said, families are tricky. BMO! Where did you get this cup?
BMO: From that guy! The guy on the cup! The guy who's face is on the cup! That guy!


=== S10E5 ===
X: Birthday boy-e-e-e!
X: Enjoying your party?
X: It's great having fun with all my friends. Well, some of my friends mostly Banana Guards.
X: Yeah, sorry about that. The Candy Kingdom is in full lockdown until I can sort out the rumors about my Uncle Gumbald. He's been gone for years, but we should stay vigilant.
X: Don't worry, PB. Now that I'm 17, I'm feelin' ready for anything. Feels like I'm really hitting my stride, y'know?
X: Finn, I want to give you your gift before I forget. It's a harmonica.
X: Awesome!
BMO: Finn, I designed an exciting new game for you.
X: Show me.
BMO: It's called "Birthday Boyfighter.
X: Looks like another hit.
X: Finn, Starchy didn't get you squat.
X: I got you a present too. It has emotional and metaphorical significance.
X: It's beautifully wrapped. Wonder what it is.
X: It's an elk's heart.
X: Oh, cool. I don't have one of those.
X: What's that sound?
X: It's zombies.
X: Sounds like hooves.
X: Zombie cows.
X: You're green!
X: I'm the Green Knight! And before you ask, yes, of course, I brought you a birthday present. It's a battle axe.
X: That's some axe. Am I an axe guy though? I've always thought of myself as a sword guy.
X: But only if you play me a game for it.
X: What's the game?
X: Oh, this game is called "All you have to do is strike me with it, and it is yours."
X: Mm? I can't axe some stranger. Wait a minute! Where's Jake? I know what's going on.
X: No, I don't think you do.
X: Relax, Princess. Jake loves playing birthday pranks on me.
X: Yes, of course One of Jake's classic pranks.
X: Okay, I'm in.
X: May your aim be steady.
X: I win!
X: Yeah, Finn! Yeah, Finn!
X: Happy birthday, Finn.
X: Jake! When did you Whose head did I Are you pranking me?
X: What? No. My prank is this fake-out gift. Huh?
X: What's this guy's deal?
X: Oh, nuh-uh! Banana guards, surround him! And be on the lookout for anything else strange!
X: Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup! Surrender, please.
X: Princess, is that strange?
X: Yes!
X: I did good.
X: My guards!
X: I got this. Raah! Eel!
X: Get him!
X: Aw.
X: He might have an invisible shield. But I'm not sure, because it's invisible.
X: Owiee. Yes. It's an invisible shield.
X: An invisible shield. I've got a device for the dissolution of invisible shields.
X: Impossible.
X: Heh!
X: Back off, everyone. He's using some advanced mystery tech.
X: Okay, let's talk.
X: What do you want to talk about?
X: Where did you come from? Why are you playing this weird game with Finn?
X: He's playing Mr. Laughing Silent Guy.
X: Game's over, bro.
X: The game isn't over until I strike you.
X: Hmm. Let's come up with a better way to settle this, like reasonable late teens.
X: I'm listening.
X: Well, we've got everything set up for party games. How about if I beat you two out of three, you got to answer our questions.
X: Psst! Nuh!
X: And if I win chop, chop.
X: Deal.
X: Wait, Finn, I think he's plotting something.
X: I-It's fine. I'm 17. I'm hittin' my stride.
X: Hey, Green Knight, why are they all mimey?
X: Ah, just to keep things fair.
X: I don't think he can hear us.
X: Okay, guy. Why don't we start with something basic like balls and coconuts. Hup! Hup! Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup. Ba-ba-ba-boom! Boom!
X: Okay, Finn! Yeah, yeah! You got it, Finn! You go, boy!
X: Aw, what? I'll let you have that one, 'cause I'm a big boy today. But let's see you try and beat four out of five, huh?
X: How do you like them coconuts?
X: I hate them coconuts.
X: Something's wrong.
X: Yeah, I swear that looked fake.
X: It was. I saw it all with my Huntress vision. Finn is totally getting played.
X: All right. You got a freaky curveball, man. But can you climb a greasy pole?
X: A greasy pole?! It's hard enough climbing a non-greasy pole!
X: Ready?
X: Mm-hmm!
X: One, two, three, go!
X: Huh?
X: Finn, you climb so good. I guess you win this round.
X: Hmm.
BMO: Yay, Finn!
X: Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
X: That's right! Yay, yay! Now's our chance, BMO.
BMO: I-Is Finn gonna be okay?
X: He's got this. He's 17.
X: Who's the ma-a-an? Who's the 17-year-old ma-a-a-an? Hoo! You've been a good sport, so I'll let you choose the tiebreaker.
X: Don't do it! Wait, don't do it! Not a good idea!
X: Very well. Hmm How about a game of some good old-fashioned arm wrestling?
X: Arm wrestling, huh? I see what you did there. My guns are obviously weak as heck from climbing that greasy pole. If only I had some kind of superhuman robot arm. Bam!
X: Three, two, one, go!
X: Ahh!
X: You can't tell from my face, but I am smiling triumphantly.
X: Nooo! It's my birthday!
X: I know. It's my birthday, too.
X: Fern?
X: Oh, no! No! Finn!
X: Fern! We've seen enough.
X: Finn! Finn! Finn, are you all right?
X: I love you, Finn!
X: Quick, eat this elk's heart.
X: What is this?
X: It's a family reunion.
X: Uncle Gumbald, Cousin Chicle, Aunt Lolly. How are you back?!
X: Here's a hint "Oh, my glob".
X: Lumpy Space Princess. When she reset Ooo, she reset you.
X: For 800 years, you kept us imprisoned, Princezzin.
X: No, you were happier as candy people.
X: We thought we were. But don't worry it's your turn to be happy now. Get juiced.
X: Back off, gumwad!
X: The vampire girl is legitimately scary. Very well. You've witnessed our superior technology and watched your champion crushed.
X: We'll go for now.
X: This is my worst B-day ever.
X: Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you
X: Happy birthday Mr.Finn Mert-ens
X: Happy birthday to you.


=== S10E9 ===
X: "B.R.B. - Jake". Hmm. B.R.B... B.R.B. Bring regular babies. Big red balls. No. Beautiful rump burger.
BMO: What you doing, Finn?
X: Jake left me this note, but I, uh I can't remem what the abbreve means.
BMO: It's for me! This is Jake's special code to tell me he loves me.
X: No, it's something normal like, uh...
BMO: Be right back.
X: Right! "Be right back!" So dumb. Cool. Jake'll be right back.
BMO: Look, Finn! My Jake Valentines. He leaves them for me when he goes out.
X: That's cute, BMO.
BMO: Yeah, I know.
X: Oh, Ble. I love Ble! I'll read some Ble 'til Jake gets back, I guess.
X: Ja - I mean, BMO!
X: Check this funny caption I just wrote.
BMO: Hmm. No humor detected.
X: What? No, it's - it's like... this guy's problem is a tiger biting his foot, and talking to this guy isn't helping! Like, "Ouch! Hey, this isn't helping!" You know, like, it's, you know, like...
BMO: Was the tiger already biting his foot? Or did the tiger bite his foot after he lay down on the couch? Because that is the bearded man's responsibility.
X: BMO, I love you, but you don't understand comedy.
BMO: Maybe it's just not funny.
X: This is funny, and I'm gonna prove it!
BMO: You are?
X: Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty bored, and this is really funny, BMO.
BMO: Prove it!
X: Fine! I'm going to!
BMO: Fine! I'll be right here!
X: Fine!
BMO: Fine!
X: Bwee-woo-bwee-woo! This is a drill!
X: Oh no! A real drill?!
X: You two, raise your resinous glaze shields!
X: Oh, oh, oh, oh!
X: Activate the B.H.T. to preserve freshness!
X: We're not ready.
X: Intruder! Intruder! It's our friend, Finn!
X: What's all the hubbub, Bubs?
X: Oh, just some precautionary exercises in case our primary alarm and defense system fails.
X: Cool. Cool. Hey, can you look at this funny thing I wrote?
X: Oh, sure! I'm fascinated by humor. Hmm! Yes. Certainly what this hirsute gentleman needs is a tetanus shot. Excellent point, Finn.
X: No, but... is it funny? Never mind.
X: I don't have time to explain the psychology of humor to you. But I'd like you to read this book.
X: Thank you, Princess.
X: Der Witz Und Seine Beziehung Zum Unterbewussten. "The Joke and his Relation to the Unconscious". It's printed in Gebrochene Schrift, which I think is easier on the eyes.
X: "Der Witz Und... Der Witz Und... See-einy... Bezeyhung... Zumbewuzzzz..." Ugh! PB's too smart. That's why she doesn't get my joke. I mean... it's funny. Uh, it's super funny. Turbo-nerds like PB just aren't the right audience for this sort of thing, you know? I should show this to normal people, the common folk. The busy woman on the go. The regular Joe or Josephine. Or somebody like Ice King, who's desperate for my approval.
X: Finn, this is so funny! A kitty with big teeth?! Come on!
X: Yeah, I didn't draw that, but cool. Well, thanks for-
X: Oh, yeah. But, uh, what if - and I'm just spitballin'. What if it was something more like, "Hey, Doc! I got a caveman in my teeth!" Huh?
X: Haha! Whoo!
X: Heh. Yeah. That's pretty good, I guess.
X: Oh, is this Ble? I love Ble! That one with the two cops who are always accidentally arresting each other.
X: Right?! And "Animal Quackers"!
X: I've been mailing them my short stories and comics for as long as I can remember. But, uh, nary a piece published. Nary a piece. Nary a piece! I hate Ble! Sittin' in their ivory towers! They don't know comedy! They don't understand the common folk! The busy woman on the go!
X: The average Joe or Josephine! Right!
X: See? We got the goods, you and I, and they've lost their touch. Hey, if we want them to touch our goods, we should go down there and confront them face-to-face.
X: And if I get my winning caption printed, everybody will know it's funny! I'm talking about you, BMO. But, uh, where do they print Ble?
X: Oh, yeah. I don't, uh... Oh! Oh! Yeah, hold this. I'll use my... demonic wishing eye!
X: Hello, Ice King.
X: Hello, Wishy!
X: What do you like to wish for?
X: I wish to go to Ble!
X: You go, girl!
X: Whoa. Why don't you just use that thing all the time?
X: Oh, it takes a piece of your soul each time you use it. But look! The legendary Bledquarters!
X: It must be so fun to work here, just sittin' around, making up jokes all day.
X: Hey! Hey.
X: Aww. Who are you?
X: I'm a pudding troll, and I guard this humor magazine.
X: Uhhhh, why?
X: It's... my job.
X: Why is this your job?
X: I... applied? I'm maybe not following you. I think I better escort you off the premises.
X: No! No, no, no. We just want to pitch a cartoon caption!
X: Hey, Big Tina, it's your time to shine, okay?
X: Waahh!
X: Okay, what's our plan here?
X: Maybe if we eat all this ammo, he'll be forced to make more for us.
X: Wait. You can fly!
X: Uh-oh! Angle up, Big Tina!
X: Uh-oh! Ugh!
X: You win. Fine. I've never let anyone inside before, so I hope you have an amazing pitch.
X: Hey! These are all my submissions! They kept them in a big pile by the door... Seems like a good sign!
X: Well, shoot, man. Looks like everyone here is crazy dead.
X: I've been guarding dead people for five hundred years. Wow, I need to sit with that.
X: This means that Ble Magazine is dead, too! Now how am I supposed to prove my caption's funny.
X: Ding dong! I found Ble 217! We can see what the winning caption was.
X: It's about time us young guns took the reins.
X: Hello, boys. Now let's roll these presses one last time.
X: Our very own Ble Magazine.
X: Baby Detectives", some, looks like, pudding jokes...
X: Big Tina wrote those!
X: Baby Detectives Go to College", and, of course, your caption!
X: Wow. It looks amazing in print.
X: Guys, I'm gonna be honest, just speaking as an average Josephine, I really don't get that caption.
X: Maybe it doesn't matter if my caption is funny or not. I think I just wanted to be part of Ble. It's something I've been a fan of for so long. And maybe we can bring it back. There's no reason it can't have a new dawn. A Blennaissance!
X: Okay, boys, close her down!
X: No, you're right. Can't be nostalgic!
X: Man, that caption was amazing in my head. Maybe I'm not a very funny person. Like, I got low comedy stats. That's kind of a bummer.
X: Yo, BMO. Check it out! I got Ble to publish my caption, even though I don't need you to think I'm funny anymo-


=== S10E13 ===
X: Haha, you're doing it wrong. Like this.
X: Shermy, this is silly as heck. Beatboxing is for babies.
X: No, it's not. I am a man.
X: I don't know about that, but you should start thinking about your future.
X: What about you, Princess Zip? What are your goals?
X: Ha! Princess Zip's got a one-track mind!
X: Prize Ball Guardian's back!
X: Let's get 'em!
X: Get that boulder!
X: Hup! Whap!
X: Ha! Here it comes!
X: Boy! My knots suck!
X: Yeah, I see you.
X: Hey, Sherm, you see this?
X: Nope.
X: It looks like the Guardian scuffed something up.
X: Ohhh! Whoa!
X: It's beautiful! Let's take it home, and I'll learn about it with my brain.
X: You and your brain!
X: ♪ "On a tropical island, on a tropical island..." ♪
X: It looks so old, Beth! Whose do you think it is... or was?
X: There's no markings on it or anything. I think we should find the King of Ooo and ask him.
X: What? Beth, the King of Ooo is just a myth... Come on, Beth!
X: That's what I thought, too, but I was doing some research at the library–
X: Nooooo! Not the library! You can't make me!
X: Shermy, I have the book here. Already checked it out.
X: Oh.
X: He's supposed to have lived in a cave at the top of Mount Cragdor.
X: Really?
X: Uh-huh... He's supposed to have lived forever.
X: Come on, Beth! Come on, come on, come on!
X: Come on, Beth! Come on, come on, come on!
X: I did it. I found him! The King of Ooo.
BMO: Welcome, friends, I've been expecting you. Because of my proximity radar. Hehehe... Come on inside.
X: Wow! King of Ooo, you must be rich!
BMO: Yeah, that's me alright.
BMO: I'm sure you are very thirsty after your journ...
X: Whoops...
X: This place is wild. Huh? This is crazy!
BMO: Please be careful with...
X: Sorry, sir... My big feet.
X: Hey, Beth, look. I'm a princess, too
X: Shermy...
X: I-I think it's okay...
X: Be careful... This stuff isn't ours. Woops. Oh...
BMO: Well, goodbye!
X: Oh, no, no...
BMO: Have fun on the other side of this door.
X: But... We came here to ask about something.
BMO: No, don't worry about it. Please leav...
X: Do you recognize it?
BMO: Yeah... It belonged to my best friend. Fred!
X: Fred!
BMO: No... Not Fred... His name was, Phil! He was an amazing hero, and he was there at the end.
BMO: Do you know about The Great Gumwar?
X: Mnm-mnm.
BMO: Well, get ready to have your hair blown back!
X: Hey, there it is again! It's close.
X: Let me see!
X: Maja?
X: Come on!
X: Hey, just-
X: Let me- Maja's got smoke coming off her.
X: You think they're with the Gumbaldians?
X: I don't know, but they're flippin' freakin' me out. Guess we better tell PB, huh?
X: Yeah, I guess.
X: Hey man, don't even worry about all this war stuff. I know we'll find a way to fix this thing. Come on! You'll see.
X: And so the Princess was mother to her own uncle, and that made him mad. But she had friends, and he had friends, so they decided to have a bad fight - the biggest fight that Ooo had ever seen.
X: Then it's settled. At the stroke of high noon, when the sun is at its most zenith-est, Banana Battalions three and four will initiate operation "Shut the Door", forming a pincer formation around Gumbald's exposed nether legions, isolating his rear and -
X: Um, excuse me? Excuse me. Princess, if I may. I think I have a plan that'll put an end to all this tonight. I just need a Bowie knife, a snowmobile, a parachute, rubber gloves, and, uh...
X: Terrible, mm! Terrible plan!... Mm! No!
X: But, but my -
X: My plan! Hot air balloon!
X: Hey! Now's not the time. Unless we win this fight today, we all get to take a nice Pep-Butt-style sponge bath in Uncle Gumbald's extra-strength lobotomy sauce, understand?
X: No.
X: Not really.
X: Well I do, so we're doing this my way. Now-
X: Um, PB?
X: Finn, you're back. How goes the scouting?
X: Um-
X: We saw Normal Man and Betty flying around with Maja, and they were chanting.
X: Hmm, very peculiar.
X: Hey, maybe this is, like, a bad omen. Like, to see the King of Mars, um, up among the stars? It's like a bad omen, and you should call off the battle. I think I heard that somewhere...
X: Low battery. Please connect to power...
X: Long live Gumbaldia!
X: Stonk! That dang Gumbald just peeped all my tactics! He's left me no choice. The attack begins now.
Princess Bubblegum
X: Well, that settles it then. If we know, and she knows, and we know she knows we know - which we do - then we know we have no choice. We must strike now. Ladies and gentlemen, to war!
X: A word?
X: All right, just make it quick. ...Please.
X: Well, I know you're under a lot of pressure here, but I... I just wanna ask you to reconsider. I mean, I don't like to flaunt my suffering cred, but I've lived through something like this once before, and... I'm just not really tryin' to help start that all up again.
X: I understand, Marceline, I really do. But I just can't see another way out of this. Look, I've gotta go. Let's talk more when this is all over. Wish me luck, okay?
X: Good luck!
X: What if PB's right about this? Maybe she'll just go whup Gumbald's rear, and then things'll go back to normal.
X: Nah, man, she's wrong. This is all wrong. Even if she wins now, this is never gonna end; I can feel it. It's like the whole world's going crazy, man, like we're living in, one, big...
X: Finn?
X: ... one big nightmare.
X: Here we go.
X: War! War! War! War! War! War!
X: Banana Guard 500s, you're on!
X: Up we go. In position, ma'am. Code name, "Father's Brother", appears testy.
X: Is this a banana? Hey, niece!
X: Yes?
X: Wait!
X: What!? Dang it, Finn!
X: PB! He sees that you're serious! Maybe he'll back down now. Please listen to me! We've been friends for a long time.
X: Okay, Finn. We'll give him one last chance.
X: What? Come on.
X: Here they come!
X: Hurry this up. I want a war.
X: Hey, Fern.
X: Uncle Gumbald, I demand that you de-escalate your forces now.
X: Listen to yourself. You're a toddler, Bonnibel.
X: SURRENDER OR DIE!
X: No!
X: That's my cue!
X: What?
X: Hya-pow!
X: They're dead! They're actually dead!
X: And so they were dead. ...No, not dead.
X: What is this place? Finn?
X: Last resort! Sorry, PB, but you were acting like total nuts out there. Now you guys have to hash this out in the unconscious world.
X: This is... a dream?
X: Yeah, man. You can basically do anything in dreams.
X: Sneak attack! If we destroy them here, maybe they'll die in the real world.
X: Psst! Not if I destroy you first!
X: No! We need love, not war!
X: Good idea. Love bazooka! Put down your weapons, or I'll bazooka you!
X: No!
X: Thank goodness for a singing pot beast to de-escalate the situation.
X: Oh, this sandwich is way too much for me. Jermaine always liked splitting sandwiches.
X: Mmm! Thanks, bro.
X: I'm gonna figure out how to wake myself up and take my revenge on you sleeping chumps!
X: You're leaving me?
X: You're on your own, kid.
X: He's rooting into the ground. Ready, aim...
X: No! You're supposed to be having some kind of epiphany!
X: Fern! Aah!
X: I don't need your help.
X: Jake? Help me!
X: I want to help you, but I can't lose this job.
X: Waiter! Oh, waiter!
X: Dude...
X: I'm going to fly around, and wreck things, until I feel better! Or until I tire myself out.
X: Peaceful thoughts... Fern!
X: It all looks so good. Bad bird!
X: Everybody gets an evil doppelganger but me.
X: I'll be your evil doppelganger!
X: Jermaine, you're the best!
X: Enough, Gumbald!
X: Pinch me, I want to wake up!
X: Gumbald! We're ending this here.
X: So be it.
X: If you could just calm down and be cool, it would be a great thing that there's two of us.
X: Why don't you just fight me like a real butterfly!?
X: We're two sides of the same coin!
X: You'll never understand what it's like to be me. I'm TORMENTED!
X: I'm ALSO that sometimes!
X: Prove it, or I'll never stop fighting you.
X: Oh geez, how's he gonna do that?
X: Hmm? Finn, we'll be right back.
X: Okay- ah!
X: Come on, little gum. Don't run away from happiness! I'm gonna fix you!
X: No, no, no!
X: Just ONE drop. Drip a drop, I drip a drop. Not gonna stop, till I drip a drop.
X: Hmm?
X: ...Wuh-what?
X: Call me... princess.
X: What are we looking for?
X: Mm, I can't quite picture it. But I'm pretty sure Finn buried it here.
X: ... In the underground balloon mall. Remember how much balloon animals used to cheer Finn up?
X: Yeah...
X: 그래. ("Yeah.")
X: Huh?
X: Uh, Lady, where's Jermaine?
X: 쉿. ("Shh.") 이런 어두운 지하굴에서는 살살 걸어야 돼. ("You have to walk carefully in a dark cave like this.")
X: Aww, sleepy puppies.
X: Yee!
X: And I'm done!
X: 걱정하지 마, 제이크! 내가 처치할게! ("Don't worry, Jake! I got this!")
X: What? Oof!
X: Your farts aren't funny, dad!
X: NOOOOOO!!! Aargh! Nightmare fart!
X: It's beautiful...
X: No! Oh, why didn't I build an armature?
X: Fern, come on! I'm not fighting you.
X: Oh, what reeks?
X: Repressed memories!
X: My vault!?
X: Proof!
X: See? this is our shared torment!
X: Dude, I blocked this stuff out for a reason!
X: Well, now you know how I feel about knowing how you feel about!
X: Okay, okay! Just make it stop!
X: We gotta confront them head on!
X: Fern. This is why I brought us here. We can defeat him together.
X: No fear.
X: So you're the nasty grass wad that's been holding my Finn boy hostage.
X: Without me, he's got no body. So back off.
X: You sicken me.
X: I'm me again. It feels like it's been years.
X: He was right. I've got no body.
X: Ah, don't worry. It's just a dream!
X: Never mind! They're okay!
X: Fern! You really are disintegrating!
X: My bad.
X: Bonnie, I...
X: I'm so sorry for what I put you through for all those centuries. The Candy Kingdom was your dream, and I took it from you.
X: Bonnie, that means so much to me. Come. From now on, we'll live in peace. Drat.
X: WHAT?!
X: He never was the epiphany type. But I am willing to let bygones be bygones.
X: Very well. Two Candy Kingdoms, it is!
X: Hurray!
X: And so, in the end, they decided not to have the big fight.
X: Oh! So you meant, like, the end of the war. I thought you meant like the end of the world.
BMO: No, no, no. That happened next.
X: So I guess everyone's just going home, huh?
X: Yep.
X: We donked up for real.
X: Jake... what am I lookin' at?
X: Uh... we saved the day. So, maybe that big baby's here to give us presents for doing a good job?
X: Okay, I'm not an expert, but this seems bad.
X: You ain't kiddin', shrubs.
X: Oh - no - !
X: Bonnie! What did you do?!
X: It wasn't me!
X: GOLB!
X: Look, Betty. I keep seeing reference to this mysterious entity that embodies chaos.
X: That's great! Come on, let's make sundaes.
X: GOLB would say ice cream is without meaning. Just empty calories devoid of purpose.
X: Good thing he isn't here then.
X: His presence is felt in every crevice where chaos lurks. Imagine if we could somehow harness all that dank energy...!
X: Hey! You want some cherries with that chocolate syrup?
X: Sure.
X: Catch!
X: Have you thought about using sliced almonds for the sundaes?
X: ...I don't know who that is!
X: Don't let it touch you!
X: No, I'm a loner!
X: Peebs, this is the worst thing ever! If somebody doesn't stop this, it could be the end of Ooo!
X: You're right, Marceline. I gotta do something! Banana guards!
X: Uh, no.
X: Obey my command! Flee for your lives! If you fight, the demon will just add you to its mass!
X: Can we flee in a panic?
X: Yes!
X: FYI, Princess, I'm not going anywhere!
X: I'm also staying.
X: Thanks, guys.
X: I'm in, too. This is a war I have to fight. We all have to.
X: Me too! I'll defend Ooo down to my last blade.
X: Gumball guardians!
X: Yes, mom?
X: Stop that monster!
X: Okay. Gross.
X: Normal Man! Come on, wake up!
X: Is that Ice King?
X: How do we stop these guys? Come on, Jake.
X: H-H-H-Horse!
X: Ugh! My balance!
X: War is the worst, dude!
X: My guardian!
X: Ice King! Ice King!
X: What's up?
X: Ho-ho-ho.
X: How do I stop this! What?
X: You are the only one who can stop this! Betty's up there, trying to harness the power of GOLB! We have to snap her out of that trance and banish GOLB, or we're all doomed! If anyone can do it, it's you.
X: Sounds great! Im'a save the world!
X: Enemy threat restrained.
X: They got him!
X: Help me, mom. I'm turning nasty...
X: Princess, we came back to help! Eee! Help us, princess!
X: Ugh!
X: Evil penguins!
X: Don't worry, guys!
X: Jake!
X: I believe in you, Ice King!
X: So this is it. Oh tender lad! I give you the parting gift of my lips.
X: I find your proposal... ...ACCEPTABLE!
X: You're welcome.
X: Betty! You have to stop this!
X: Go ahead. Talk to her, IK.
X: Who? Oh, it's weird lady! Hey, lady. ...I'm diggin' your primitive dance style!
X: No! You're supposed to stop her, not encourage her! You gotta dig deep inside and find those magical words to shake her outta that trance! Get personal and emotional!
X: Personal? Emotional? Oh! Just like a fan-fic!
X: No!...
X: "I feel like nothing was real until I met you. I feel like we connect. And I really get you. If I said 'You're a beautiful girl, would it upset you? The way you look tonight, silhouetted, I'll never forget it."

X: This world will end unless GOLB is banished. So I'm gonna make... the wish.
X: Guys, it's clenching!
X: We'll make the wish after we escape!
X: I have to do it here. The crown could revert once we leave. I gamed it out.
X: But I can't...
X: I'm sorry for messing everything up.
X: Wait! Betty? Betty!
X: I wish to banish GOLB from this world.
X: Uh-oh, um... I wish for GOLB to disappear, I wish for GOLB to disappear!
X: No! He's too strong! Even for the crown. However it has to happen. ...I wish for the power to keep Simon safe.
X: Slide faster, you ding-dongs! Simon!
X: Hmm, check, plea-
X: We heard there was a war-
X: She did it! Yeah, Betty! Whoo!
X: What has she done?...
X: Well, great! I don't like this guy either!
X: No... Betty? Betty!
X: You're back. It's what she wanted more than anything in the world.
X: Wenk.
X: Jump him! He's gonna wish to be all space villain!
X: What?
X: He's a big evil alien stuck in a penguin!
X: Oh!... I see.
X: ... la-ba-droo-la-da-boo! Say, where's Gunter, my beautiful child that I love?
X: Oh, never mind, I think he just wished to be Ice King?
X: And for some drums, I guess? Yeah, this is fine.
X: Whew.
X: Hey, Finn... I'm not doing so good.
X: Oh, no.
X: Yeah... I just wish I could see the treehouse one more time.
X: Yeah dude, of course! Let's go there right now.
X: That's okay... Just promise to plant me there.
X: You feel ready?
[Finn buries the Finnseed, which quickly grows into a young willow tree.
X: Whoa.
X: Hey, Finn.
X: Excuse me. Hi, PB.
X: I just wanted to come say... thank you for disobeying my orders this morning. I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
X: See you tomorrow.
X: You're getting tall. Good night!
X: Night, PB!
BMO: That's the end.
X: I thought this story was about the end of Ooo.
BMO: ... Pretty much.
X: But what happened to Phil and Jake after that?
X: Or Princess Bubblegum?
BMO: Eh, y'know. They kept living their lives. Thank you for visiting the King of Ooo, goodbye.
X: The king was very polite for a king, don't you think?
X: I wish we could find that little Fern tree, see if that story is true.
X: The tree would be a big tree now. It's, like, a thousand years old.
X: Oh, a big tree... Hey! I know where that tree is! C'mon, Beth!
X: I came pretty close to biting it back there. I never would have gotten out of there without your singing. It's amazing how strong that song was.
X: Music is powerful, man. It speaks to a primal pit in our brains. It makes anyone wanna get up and get their knees goin', gotta get 'em pumpin' pumpin' pumpin'. Boompa-boompa-boom.
X: What do you think, Music Hole?
X: Jake's right. A good song can really wrap people up in a mood, better than any words alone could. Actually, I've been working on a new song myself. It's about a really specific feeling that's hard to describe. Would you like to hear it?
X: Sure!
X: Yeah!
X: Check it out, dude.
X: Very pretty.
X: Lift that sword, Shermy.
X: Oh, yeah!
